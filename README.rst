ScanCode LicenseDB
====================

LicenseDB is likely the largest collection of software licenses available on
Earth and maybe beyond.

LicenseDB is a free and open database of mostly all the software licenses, in
particular all the open-source software licenses, with over 2000 curated licenses
texts and their metadata.

LicenseDB is built from the ScanCode Toolkit license dataset. ScanCode Toolkit
is a leading open source code scanner and license detection engine.

LicenseDB is an essential reference license resource for license compliance and
SBOMs. LicenseDB includes all the SPDX and OSI licenses together with an extended
curated collection of other licenses and license metadata. These licenses are
carefully reviewed and curated and continusouly updated by an open community of
contributors.

LicenseDB is available as a web site, an JSON or YAML API and a git repository
making it easy to reuse and integrate in tools that need a database of reference
software licenses.


Browse
------

The web site is published at: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/
You can search the licenses by name, key and other attributes.

This is updated daily by a GitHub action with updates from scancode-toolkit
develop, if any.


API
------

The index is available at either:

- as JSON: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/index.json
- as YAML: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/index.yml

The index contains a list of the license keys with key metadata and links to the
license details and texts using this license key as an identifier:

- as JSON: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/<license key>.json
  for instance: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/gpl-2.0.json

- as YAML: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/<license key>.yml
  for instance: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/gpl-2.0.yml

- as text for the full license text: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/<license key>.LICENSE 
  for instance: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/gpl-2.0.LICENSE


This index and the static website is also available offline with ScanCode Toolkit as a
console script available at configure/install. Sample command::
  
  scancode-license-data --path PATH
