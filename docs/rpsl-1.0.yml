  \ (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise\nindicating your acceptance of this\
  \ License), a worldwide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of\
  \ Licensor's copyrights cover\nthe Original Code, to do the following:\n\n2.1 You may reproduce,\
  \ display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code,\nprovided that in each instance:\n\n(a)\
  \ You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright\nand other proprietary\
  \ notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the\nOriginal Code, and keep intact\
  \ all notices in the Original Code that refer to\nthis License;\n\n(b) You must include a\
  \ copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of\nCovered Code and documentation You\
  \ distribute, and You may not offer or impose\nany terms on such Source Code that alter or\
  \ restrict this License or the\nrecipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section\
  \ 6;\n\n(c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in\nExhibit\
  \ A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause\nthe modified files\
  \ to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files\nand the date of any change;\n\
  \n(d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications\npublicly available\
  \ under the terms of this License, including the license grants\nset forth in Section 3 below,\
  \ for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or\ntwelve (12) months from the date of initial\
  \ Deployment, whichever is longer. You\nshould preferably distribute the Source Code of Your\
  \ Deployed Modifications\nelectronically (e.g. download from a web site); and\n\n(e) if You\
  \ Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must\ninclude a prominent\
  \ notice, in the code itself as well as in related\ndocumentation, stating that Source Code\
  \ of the Covered Code is available under\nthe terms of this License with information on how\
  \ and where to obtain such\nSource Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set\
  \ forth in Exhibit A\nin the \"about\" box or other appropriate place where other copyright\
  \ notices are\nplaced, including any packaging materials.\n\n2.2 You expressly acknowledge\
  \ and agree that although Licensor and each\nContributor grants the licenses to their respective\
  \ portions of the Covered Code\nset forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or\
  \ any Contributor that\nthe Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\
  \ property\nrights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability\n\
  to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\nintellectual property\
  \ rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\nrights and licenses granted hereunder,\
  \ You hereby assume sole responsibility to\nsecure any other intellectual property rights\
  \ needed, if any. For example, if a\nthird party patent license is required to allow You to\
  \ make, use, sell, import\nor offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to\
  \ acquire such\nlicense(s).\n\n2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\
  \ hereby grants\nYou, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using\n\
  Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a\nworldwide, royalty-free,\
  \ perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under\nLicensor's Applicable Patent Rights to make,\
  \ use, sell, offer for sale and\nimport the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you\
  \ comply with the\nterms of this License.\n\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a\
  \ condition to, the licenses granted\nto You under this License:\n\n(a) You grant to Licensor\
  \ and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual,\nirrevocable, royalty free license under\
  \ Your Applicable Patent Rights and other\nintellectual property rights owned or controlled\
  \ by You, to make, sell, offer\nfor sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify,\
  \ distribute and\nDeploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses\n\
  under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\n\n(b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,\
  \ worldwide,\nroyalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent\n\
  Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to\nmake, use, sell,\
  \ offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform,\ndistribute, modify or have modified\
  \ (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries),\nsublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in\
  \ any form and for any purpose,\nthrough multiple tiers of distribution.\n\n(c) You agree\
  \ not use any information derived from Your use and review of the\nCovered Code, including\
  \ but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may\nbe contained in the Covered Code,\
  \ for the purpose of asserting any of Your\npatent rights, or assisting a third party to assert\
  \ any of its patent rights,\nagainst Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n4. Derivative Works.\
  \ You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code\nwith other code not otherwise\
  \ governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Derivative Work as an integrated\
  \ product. In each such instance,\nYou must make sure the requirements of this License are\
  \ fulfilled for the\nCovered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.\n\n\
  4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or\nExternally Deploy,\
  \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the\nCovered Code or any part thereof,\
  \ to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all\nthird parties under the terms of this License\
  \ and no other license except as\nprovided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code\
  \ available for the\nDerivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections\
  \ 2\nand 3, above.\n\n4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently\n\
  developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the\nCovered Code,\
  \ Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined\nin any way wtih the Covered\
  \ Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger\nDerivative Work, are exempt from the conditions\
  \ described in Section 4.1 but\nonly to the extent that: the software module, including any\
  \ software that is\nlinked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software\n\
  module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source\nLicenses. Notwithstanding\
  \ the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the\nterms of this License. Thus, the\
  \ entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a\ncombination of the RPSL (for Covered Code)\
  \ and a Compatible Source License for\nany independently developed software modules within\
  \ the Derivative Work. The\nforegoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License\
  \ would\nordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with,\nother\
  \ software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For\nexample, although the\
  \ Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be\ncombined with proprietary software\
  \ that is not subject to the MPL, if\nMPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed\
  \ code could not be\ncombined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general\
  \ intent of\nthis section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are\n\
  wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for\ndetermining\
  \ whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your\nlicense to such software.\n\
  \n4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the\nCovered Code\
  \ (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage\nor distribution medium\
  \ does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense. If You deliver the Covered\
  \ Code for combination and/or integration with\nan application previously provided by You\
  \ (for example, via automatic updating\ntechnology), such combination and/or integration constitutes\
  \ a Derivative Work\nsubject to the terms of this License.\n\n5. Exclusions From License Grant.\
  \ Nothing in this License shall be deemed to\ngrant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\
  \ patents, trade secrets or any other\nintellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor\
  \ except as expressly stated\nherein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or\
  \ any Contributor\neven if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License\n\
  shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms\nfrom this\
  \ License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\nlicense. Modifications,\
  \ Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of\nCovered Code with other technology provided\
  \ by Licensor or third parties may\nrequire additional patent licenses from Licensor which\
  \ Licensor may grant in its\nsole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the\
  \ Original Code or\ncombinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.\n\n\
  5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or\ntrade names\
  \ owned by Licensor (\"Licensor Marks\" defined in Exhibit C) or to any\ntrademark or trade\
  \ name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be\nused to endorse or promote\
  \ products derived from the Original Code other than as\npermitted by the Licensor Trademark\
  \ Policy defined in Exhibit C.\n\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge\
  \ a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent\
  \ with\nthe scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more\nrecipients\
  \ of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and\nas Your sole responsibility,\
  \ and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor.\nYou must obtain the recipient's agreement\
  \ that any such Additional Terms are\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,\
  \ defend and hold\nLicensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or\
  \ claims\nasserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional\n\
  Terms.\n\n7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of\n\
  this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing\nversion number.\
  \ Once Original Code has been published under a particular version\nof this License, You may\
  \ continue to use it under the terms of that version. You\nmay also choose to use such Original\
  \ Code under the terms of any subsequent\nversion of this License published by Licensor. No\
  \ one other than Licensor has\nthe right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\
  \ under this\nLicense.\n\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole\
  \ or in part\npre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain\n\
  errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or\ncontain inaccuracies.\
  \ You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the\nCovered Code, or any portion thereof,\
  \ is at Your sole and entire risk. THE\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY,\
  \ UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF\nANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED\
  \ TO AS\n\"LICENSOR\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY\n\
  DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED\
  \ TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF\nSATISFACTORY QUALITY,\
  \ OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET\nENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT\
  \ OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH\nCONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE\
  \ WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE\nCOVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE\
  \ WILL MEET YOUR\nREQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED\
  \ OR\nERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR\nWRITTEN\
  \ DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR\nAUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE\
  \ OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You\nacknowledge that the Covered Code is not\
  \ intended for use in high risk\nactivities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction,\
  \ operation\nor maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft\ncommunication\
  \ systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure\nof the Covered Code\
  \ could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or\nenvironmental damage. Licensor\
  \ disclaims any express or implied warranty of\nfitness for such uses.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF\
  \ LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT\nSHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR\
  \ BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nINDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\
  \ OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR\nYOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION\
  \ THEREOF, WHETHER\nUNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT\n\
  LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH\nCONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN\
  \ ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL\
  \ PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL\
  \ OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event\nshall Licensor's\
  \ total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be\nrequired by applicable law)\
  \ under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars\n($10.00).\n\n10. Ownership. Subject\
  \ to the licenses granted under this License, each\nContributor retains all rights, title\
  \ and interest in and to any Modifications\nmade by such Contributor. Licensor retains all\
  \ rights, title and interest in and\nto the Original Code and any Modifications made by or\
  \ on behalf of Licensor\n(\"Licensor Modifications\"), and such Licensor Modifications will\
  \ not be\nautomatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion,\nchoose\
  \ to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on\ndifferent terms from those\
  \ contained in this License or may choose not to\nlicense them at all.\n\n11. Termination.\
  \ \n\n11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless\nterminated\
  \ as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\nterminate:\n\n(a)\
  \ automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any\nterm(s) of this\
  \ License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming\naware of such breach;\n\
  \n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b);\nor\n\n\
  (c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the\nterm of this\
  \ License, commence an action for patent infringement against\nLicensor (including by cross-claim\
  \ or counter claim in a lawsuit);\n\n(d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any\
  \ time during the term of\nthis License, commence an action for patent infringement against\
  \ any third party\nalleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other\n\
  software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter\nclaim in\
  \ a lawsuit).\n\n11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop\
  \ any\nfurther use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the\nCovered\
  \ Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your\npossession or control.\
  \ All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been\nproperly granted prior to termination\
  \ shall survive any termination of this\nLicense. Provisions which, by their nature, should\
  \ remain in effect beyond the\ntermination of this License shall survive, including but not\
  \ limited to Sections\n3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other\
  \ for\ncompensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating\n\
  this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will\nbe without\
  \ prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n\n12. Miscellaneous.\n\n12.1 Government\
  \ End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in\nFAR 2.101. Government\

  \n12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's\nright to acquire,\
  \ license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or\ndistribute technology or products\
  \ that perform the same or similar functions as,\nor otherwise compete with, Modifications,\
  \ Derivative Works, technology or\nproducts that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\
  \n12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any\nprovision\
  \ of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of\nthat or any other\
  \ provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be\
  \ construed against the drafter will not apply to\nthis License.\n\n12.5 Severability. (a)\
