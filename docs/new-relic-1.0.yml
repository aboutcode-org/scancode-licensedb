text: "## New Relic Software License v1.0\n\n### Acceptance\n\nThis software license applies\
  \ to the repositories, directories, or files that it has been associated with (referred to\
  \ here as “the Software”). In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to\
  \ them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.\n\n### License\n\n\
  New Relic grants you a license for the Software to do everything you might do with the Software\
  \ that would otherwise infringe the New Relic’s copyrights or patent rights, conditional on\
  \ only using the Software for Permitted Purposes and compliance with all other Restrictions\
  \ on Use. All other uses are prohibited. \n\n### Permitted Purposes\n\nThe Software is solely\
  \ for use with New Relic’s proprietary SaaS service (“New Relic Service”). To use the Software\
  \ you must have a valid and active subscription agreement to the New Relic Service. You may\
  \ not use the Software in conjunction with any other similar service.\n\n### Restrictions\
  \ on Use\n\n1. The use of the Software is limited to you and your organization. You cannot\
  \ expose the Software to third parties via the network or use the Software on behalf of anyone\
  \ else.\n2. You cannot modify the Software. You can compile or link the Software into your\
  \ programs as described in the New Relic Documentation, but you cannot otherwise make any\
  \ derivative works of the Software.\n3. You cannot reverse engineer or decompile the Software.\
  \ \n4. You cannot use the Software for competitive analysis, benchmarking, or any purposes\
  \ that compete with or are intended to compete with New Relic.\n5. You cannot remove or obscure\
  \ any proprietary notices in the Software.\n6. You can only copy the Software to the extent\
  \ needed to use the Software within your organization. You cannot distribute the Software\
  \ to any third parties.\n7. You can only use the New Relic Services and the Software consistent\
  \ with your subscription agreement with New Relic, New Relic’s product Documentation and Acceptable\
  \ Use Policy.\n\n### Intellectual Property\n\nAny feedback provided to New Relic about the\
  \ Software, including feedback provided as source code, comments, or other copyrightable or\
  \ patentable material, is provided to New Relic under the terms of the Apache Software License,\
  \ version 2. If you do not provide attribution information or a copy of the license with your\
  \ feedback, you waive the performance of those requirements of the Apache License with respect\
  \ to New Relic. The license grant regarding any feedback is irrevocable and persists past\
  \ the termination of this license.\n\n### Termination\n\nThis license terminates when the\
  \ Software stops being provided by New Relic or when described by the New Relic subscription\
  \ agreement, whichever comes first. When this license terminates, you have a commercially\
  \ reasonable time to either remove the Software from your systems.\n\n### Other Terms\n\n\
  1. The Software is provided “AS IS.”  New Relic disclaims all warranties, whether express,\
  \ implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a\
  \ particular purpose, title, and noninfringement.\n2. To the full extent permitted by law,\
  \ New Relic will have no liability arising from or related to the Software or from this license\
  \ for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind, even\
  \ if advised of their possibility in advance, and regardless of legal theory (whether contract,\
  \ tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise).\n3. The Software may contain third-party\
  \ software, including open source software (“OSS”). The third party software is governed by\
  \ its own license and subject to its own terms, disclosed in the provided licensing information\
  \ associated with the third party components. If a source code disclosure is required under\
  \ the terms of the license covering any OSS component, the source code can be requested of\
  \ New Relic by emailing opensource@newrelic.com."
