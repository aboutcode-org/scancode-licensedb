The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board (\"SOFA\").\n\n2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any\npurpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and\nwithout payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and\nrestrictions listed below.\n\n3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,\nand use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,\non a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your\ndistribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies\nof SOFA source code files is a \"derived work\" that must comply\nwith the following requirements:\n\n     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it\n        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from\n        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and\n        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or\n        endorsed by SOFA.\n\n     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions\n        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs\n        from the original SOFA software.\n\n     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not\n        include the prefix \"iau\" or \"sofa\" or trivial modifications\n        thereof such as changes of case.\n\n     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must\n        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the\n        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA\n        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.\n\n     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source\n        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have\n        granted a further right to modify the source code of your\n        derived work.\n\n     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is\n     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,\n     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All\n     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as\n     such, as explained above.\n\n  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into\n     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or\n     by inappropriate modification.\n\n  5.

In no event will SOFA be\n     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special\n     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a\n     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any\n     claim by any third party.\n\n  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms\n     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future\n     versions will also be made available under the same terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA\n  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is\n  appreciated.\n\n  Correspondence concerning SOFA software should be addressed as\n  follows:\n      By email:  sofa@ukho.gov.uk\n      By post:   IAU SOFA Center\n                 HM Nautical Almanac Office\n                 UK Hydrographic Office\n                 Admiralty Way, Taunton\n                 Somerset, TA1 2DN\n                 United Kingdom"
