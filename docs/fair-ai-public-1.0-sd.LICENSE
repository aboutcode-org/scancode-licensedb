# Fair AI Public License 1.0-SD

Published by the [Freedom of Development Project](https://freedevproject.org).

*This "SD variant" license contains a [Prohibited Uses](#prohibited-uses)
section designed to be compatible with Stable Diffusion's license. Because of
that section, this is not a free software license. Unless you are releasing a
derivative of a Stable Diffusion model, it is not recommended that you use this
license.*

*This license comes with special requirements if you intend to allow users
to access this software over a network. See [Notices](#notices) for more
information.*

## Purpose
This license gives everyone as much permission to work with this software as 
possible, while protecting contributors from liability, protecting the 
freedom of end users, and reducing harm.

## Definitions
In this license, "model" refers to machine learning model weights, biases,
parameters, optimizer states, and any byproducts of a training or pretraining
process, whether in the form of checkpoints or any other form.

The term "derived model" refers to any model based on this model.

The term "software" also refers to any model along with documentation or
other resources provided with the software.

The term "source code" refers to the preferred form of making modifications
to software. It also includes any models, if applicable, but it does not
include any datasets used to train a model.

To "modify" also means to perform any training on a model or to combine a
model with another model.

## Acceptance
In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules. The rules of 
this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your 
license. You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that 
you cannot or will not follow. If you do not agree, then you cannot use this 
software in any way.

## Copyright
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would 
otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

## Freedom
Neither this software nor any work that is combined with this software will be 
considered a technological protection measure under the WIPO Copyright Treaty 
or any similar law. Reverse engineering of this software and of any work that 
is combined with this software is always allowed.

## Notices
You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from 
you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license along with
the corresponding source code.

If you modify this software and allow users to interact with it through a
computer network, you must ensure they have a reasonable way to receive the
corresponding source code from you, whether that is via a download link or a
prominent written offer. As a special case, if you are only allowing users to
interact with a derived model, then you may choose to provide a download link
or written offer only for the derived model.

This software, all source code, and all modifications must be provided under
this license or another license that allows everything this license allows.
Note that this does not give you permission to change the license for this
software.

## Excuse
If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with 
[Notices](#notices), you can keep your license by taking all practical steps
to comply within 30 days after the notice. If you do not do so, your license
ends immediately.

## Output
The output of this software is not covered by this license, and no contributor
claims any rights to it.

## Patent
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would 
otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

## Reliability
No contributor can revoke this license.

## Alternatives
You can also use any non-model parts of this software under the terms of the
GNU AGPL 3.0, or any later version of that license. If you do,
[No Harm](#no-harm) and [No Liability](#no-liability) still apply.

## Revisions
The Freedom of Development Project may publish revised or new versions of the
Fair AI Public License. Those new versions will be similar in spirit to this
license.

Unless a contributor specifies otherwise, you have the option of following the
terms of any later version of this license. Your choice to follow a later
version of the license will not impose additional obligations on any
contributor. Even if you do choose to follow a later version, the restrictions
of [Prohibited Uses](#prohibited-uses) will still apply.

## Survival
The provisions of [No Harm](#no-harm) and [No Liability](#no-liability) survive
the end of your license.

## No Harm
You agree that no contributor's conduct in the creation of this software has 
caused you any harm. As far as the law allows, you give up your right to pursue 
any kind of legal claim against any contributor for actions related the 
creation of this software, even if those actions broke a previous agreement.

Additionally, you agree not to use this model for harmful purposes, as listed
in [Prohibited Uses](#prohibited-uses). These restrictions do not apply to
non-model parts of this software.

## No Liability
***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or 
condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related 
to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Prohibited Uses

- In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local or 
international law or regulation;
- For the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to exploit or harm 
minors in any way;
