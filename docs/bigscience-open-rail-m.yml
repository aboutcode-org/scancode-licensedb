text: "BigScience Open RAIL-M License \ndated August 18, 2022 \n\nSection I: PREAMBLE \n\nThis\
  \ Open RAIL-M License was created by BigScience, a collaborative open innovation project aimed\
  \ at the responsible development and use of large multilingual datasets and Large Language\
  \ Models (“LLMs”). While a similar license was originally designed for the BLOOM model, we\
  \ decided to adapt it and create this license in order to propose a general open and responsible\
  \ license applicable to other machine learning based AI models (e.g. multimodal generative\
  \ models). \n\nIn short, this license strives for both the open and responsible downstream\
  \ use of the accompanying model. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration\
  \ from open source permissive licenses regarding the grant of IP rights. Referring to the\
  \ downstream responsible use, we added use-based restrictions not permitting the use of the\
  \ Model in very specific scenarios, in order for the licensor to be able to enforce the license\
  \ in case potential misuses of the Model may occur. Even though downstream derivative versions\
  \ of the model could be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always have\
  \ to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original license\
  \ (this license). \n\nThe development and use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), does not\
  \ come without concerns. The world has witnessed how AI techniques may, in some instances,\
  \ become risky for the public in general. These risks come in many forms, from racial discrimination\
  \ to the misuse of sensitive information. \n\nBigScience believes in the intersection between\
  \ open and responsible AI development; thus, this License aims to strike a balance between\
  \ both in order to enable responsible open-science in the field of AI. \nThis License governs\
  \ the use of the model (and its derivatives) and is informed by the model card associated\
  \ with the model. \n\nNOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows: \n\n1. Definitions\
  \ \n\n(a) \"License\" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution\
  \ as defined in this document. \n\n(b) “Data” means a collection of information and/or content\
  \ extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise\
  \ evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License. \n\n(c) “Output” means\
  \ the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.\
  \ \n\n(d) “Model” means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints),\
  \ consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to\
  \ the model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained\
  \ or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material. \n\n(e) “Derivatives\
  \ of the Model” means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other\
  \ model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters,\
  \ activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model\
  \ to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods\
  \ entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation\
  \ of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model. \n\n(f) “Complementary Material”\
  \ means the accompanying source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate\
  \ the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any\
  \ accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any. \n\n(g) “Distribution” means\
  \ any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives\
  \ of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available\
  \ by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access. \n\n(h) “Licensor” means\
  \ the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License,\
  \ including the persons or entities that may have rights in the Model and/or distributing\
  \ the Model. \n\n(i) \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising\
  \ permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose\
  \ and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot,\
  \ translator, image generator. \n\n(j) “Third Parties” means individuals or legal entities\
  \ that are not under common control with Licensor or You. \n\n(k) \"Contribution\" means any\
  \ work of authorship, including the original version of the Model and any modifications or\
  \ additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted\
  \ to Licensor for inclusion in the Model by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal\
  \ Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,\
  \ “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor\
  \ or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing\
  \ lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on\
  \ behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Model, but excluding\
  \ communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright\
  \ owner as \"Not a Contribution.\" \n\n(l) \"Contributor\" means Licensor and any individual\
  \ or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently\
  \ incorporated within the Model. \n\nSection II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS \n\nBoth copyright\
  \ and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material.\
  \ The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section\
  \ III. \n\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\
  \ each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\
  \ royalty-free, irrevocable \ncopyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly\
  \ perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives\
  \ of the Model. \n\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\
  \ License and where and as applicable, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
  \ worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this\
  \ paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise\
  \ transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where such license applies only to those\
  \ patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\
  \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Model to which such Contribution(s)\
  \ was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\
  \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model and/or Complementary Material or a\
  \ Contribution incorporated within the Model and/or Complementary Material constitutes direct\
  \ or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this\
