                                version 1.1

               Copyright (C) 2003, 2010, 2015 Andras Varga


                                Preamble

  This license contains the terms and conditions of using OMNeT++ in
noncommercial settings: at academic institutions for teaching and research
use and for personal or educational purposes. You will find that this
license provides noncommercial users of OMNeT++ with rights that are
similar to the well-known GNU General Public License, yet it retains the
possibility for OMNeT++ authors to financially support the development by
selling commercial licenses. In fact, if you intend to use OMNeT++ in a
&#34;for-profit&#34; environment, where research is conducted to develop or enhance
a product, is used in a commercial service offering, or when an entity uses
OMNeT++ to participate in government-funded, EU-funded, military or similar
research projects, then you need to obtain a commercial license (OMNEST).
In that case, or if you are unsure, please visit www.omnest.com to inquire about 
commercial licenses.

  What are the rights given to noncommercial users? Similarly to GPL, you
have the right to use the software, to distribute copies, to receive source
code, to change the software and distribute your modifications or the
modified software. Also similarly to the GPL, if you distribute verbatim or
modified copies of this software, they must be distributed under this
license.

  By modeling the GPL, this license guarantees that you&#39;re safe when using
OMNeT++ in your work, for teaching or research. This license guarantees
that OMNeT++ will remain available free of charge for nonprofit use. You
can modify OMNeT++ to your purposes, and you can also share your modifications.
Even in the unlikely case of the authors abandoning OMNeT++ entirely, this
license permits anyone to continue developing it from the last release, and
to create further releases under this license.

  We believe that the combination of noncommercial open-source and commercial
licensing will be beneficial for the whole user community, because income from
commercial licenses will enable faster development and a higher level of
software quality, while further enjoying the informal, open communication
and collaboration channels of open source development.

  The precise terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and
modification follow.


                         ACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. Definitions

  &#34;Program&#34; means a copy of OMNeT++, which is said to be distributed under
this Academic Public License.

  &#34;Work based on the Program&#34; means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
in the term &#34;modification&#34;.)

  &#34;Using the Program&#34; means any act of creating executables that contain or
directly use libraries that are part of the Program, running any of the
tools that are part of the Program, or creating works based on the Program.

Each licensee is addressed as &#34;you&#34;.

  1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program free of charge for
noncommercial purposes, including teaching and academic research at
universities, colleges and other educational institutions and personal
non-profit purposes. For using the Program for commercial purposes,
including but not restricted to consulting activities, design of commercial
hardware or software networking products, and joint research with a
commercial entity, government-funded, EU-funded, military or similar
research projects, you have to contact the author. Or you can also visit www.omnest.com
for an appropriate license. Permission is also granted to use the Program
for a reasonably limited period of time for the purpose of evaluating its
usefulness for a particular purpose.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 2
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose regulations for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
(If the same, independent sections are distributed as part of a package
that is otherwise reliant on, or is based on the Program, then the
distribution of the whole package, including but not restricted to the
independent section, must be on the unmodified terms of this License,
regadless of who the author of the included sections was.)

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based or reliant on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 3) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 2 and 3 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
    the program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
    in accord with Subsection b) above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Program or its derivative works; law prohibits these actions
if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it, to do so.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program are restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

                            NO WARRANTY

  10. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  11. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</code></pre>
