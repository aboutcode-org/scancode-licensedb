            The Developer shall not make any modification to the Derivative Work of the Source Code, including the Distribution ucode assigned thereto, when re-Distributing the Derivative Work of the Source Code; and

            The Developer shall register the modified Derivative Work of the Source Code into the Traceability Service and obtain the Distribution ucode to be assigned thereto; and
            The Developer shall provide this License Agreement to said third party and require said third party to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein when re-Distributing the modified Derivative Work of the Source Code.

    In the case where part of the source program Distributed under the T-License or μT-License (hereinafter called the &#34;Existing License Agreement&#34;), which specifies the terms and conditions of use applicable to the Source Code and was made by TRON Forum before commencement of this License Agreement, is included into the modified part of the Derivative Work of the Source Code by the Developer, the said Derivative Work of the Source Code shall be Distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this License Agreement. Provided, however, that the said Developer may select to Distribute the said Derivative Work of the Source Code under the terms and conditions set forth in the Existing License Agreement.
    The Developer shall be obligated to give a notice that the Source Code is used, in such a way as separately established by TRON Forum, when they use the Source Code or the Derivative Work of the Source Code, or make the Binary Code available to the End User on the Embedded Product. Provided, however, that the Developer shall be released from the obligation to give a notice under this Article in the event of the following:
        The Developer, who is a member of TRON Forum, applies for said release to TRON Forum in a manner separately determined by TRON Forum.
