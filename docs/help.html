        <p>LicenseDB is likely the largest collection of software licenses available on
        earth and may be beyond.
        </p>

        <p>LicenseDB is a free and open database of mostly all the software licenses, in
        particular all the open source software licenses, with over 2000 curated licenses
        texts and their metadata.
        </p>

        <p>LicenseDB is built from the ScanCode Toolkit license dataset. ScanCode Toolkit
        is a leading open source code scanner and license detection engine.</p>

        <p>LicenseDB is an essential reference license resource for license compliance and
        SBOMs. LicenseDB includes all the SPDX and OSI licenses together with an extended
        curated collection of other licenses and license metadata. These licenses are
        carefully reviewed and curated and continusouly updated by an open community of
        contributors.</p>

        <p>LicenseDB is available as a web site, an JSON or YAML API and a git repository
        making it easy to reuse and integrate in tools that need a database of reference
        software licenses.</p>

          <dd>
            A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) describes and defines the contribution acceptance rules for the ongoing

          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Commercial</dt>
          <dd>
            Third-party proprietary software offered under a direct commercial license between supplier and customer.
            Further fact-finding by Product Teams will be necessary to determine the code's license status and function,
            if any.

          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Copyleft</dt>
          <dd>
            Open source software with a "copyleft" license that offers irrevocable permission to the public to copy and
            redistribute the work in the same or modified form, but with the conditions that all such redistributions
            make the work available in a form that facilitates further modification and use the same license terms.
            A copyleft license can require code interacting with copyleft-licensed code to be licensed the same way.
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Copyleft Limited</dt>
          <dd>
            A license that requires you to redistribute source code, including your changes, and also to provide
            attribution for the software authors. Your obligation to redistribute source code, including proprietary
            code linked with code under this license, is limited according to license-specific rules.
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Free Restricted</dt>
          <dd>
            A Permissive-style license, that contains restrictions regarding the usage of the software
            (for example, where the software is not intended for use in nuclear power plants) or the redistribution
            of the software (for example, where commercial redistribution of the software is not allowed without
            express permission). The Free Software Foundation (FSF) says that a license with this kind of restriction
            is not really open source, although the OSI point of view is not that strict.
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Patent License</dt>
          <dd>
            A license that applies to patents rather than specific software. May be used in conjunction with other
            software license(s) that apply to a software component. 
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Permissive</dt>
          <dd>
            Open Source software that is made available under "non-copyleft" licenses. These generally require
            attribution of the included open source and may include other obligations.
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Proprietary Free</dt>
          <dd>
            Proprietary Free software that may not require a commercial license but may have specific terms and
            conditions which Product Teams are obligated to follow. Some of these terms and conditions are provided
            with or in the code or in clickable downloaded licenses. Examples are the Sun Binary Code License Agreement
            or a freely offered BSP. 
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Public Domain</dt>
          <dd>
            Open source software that is made available without explicit obligations, but which has a license notice
            that must be kept with the code per organization policy. The match may be to software, code examples
            on a website, published public domain specifications or another type of publication.
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Source-available</dt>
          <dd>
            Source-available software is software released through a source code distribution model that includes
            arrangements where the source can be viewed, and in some cases modified, but without necessarily meeting
            the criteria to be called open-source.
          </dd>
    
          <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Unstated License</dt>
          <dd>
            Third-party software that has a copyright notice, but no stated license. Common examples include code snippets
            from publications and websites (such as those from O'Reilly Media). The absence of a license poses a risk
            that the copyright owner may assert license obligations at some future time. Product Teams may need to
            contact the copyright owner to determine the license obligations, if any.
