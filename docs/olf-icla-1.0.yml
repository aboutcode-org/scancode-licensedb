  \ rights\n\nThe Contributor hereby grants the Open Logistics Foundation and any third party\
  \ who receives and/or\nuses a Work or the Contributions themselves – whether adapted or not\
  \ - , insofar as applicable to the\nrespective Contributions, to such Contributions\n\n• \
  \ the royalty-free and non-exclusive right,\n•  sublicensable for commercial and non-commercial\
  \ purposes\n•  worldwide and perpetual,\n•  irrevocable and non-terminable,\n\nto use the\
  \ Contributions in their original form or in modified, translated, edited or transformed form\
  \ on\ntheir own or as a part of a Work in the following ways:\n\n•  use them in any hardware\
  \ and software environment, - insofar as the Contribution is a software\n– in particular to\
  \ store or load them permanently or temporarily, to display them and run them,\nincluding\
  \ to the extent reproductions are necessary to that end,\n•  modify, translate, edit or transform\
  \ them in another way,\n•  store, reproduce, exhibit or publish them, distribute them in tangible\
  \ or intangible form, on any\nmedium  or  in  any  other  way,  for  commercial  and  non-commercial\
  \  purposes,  in  particular  to\ncommunicate  them  privately  or  publicly,  also  through\
  \  image,  audio  and  other  information\ncarriers, irrespective of whether by wire or wireless\
  \ means,\n•  use them in databases, data networks and online services, including the right\
  \ to make it available\nin Source Code or Object Code to users of the aforementioned databases,\
  \ networks and online\nservices for research and retrieval purposes,\n•  allow third parties\
  \ to use or operate them,\n•  use them not only for own purposes but also to provide services\
  \ to third parties,\n•  distribute them.\n\nThe  above  right  of  use  relates  to  the \
  \ Contributions,  in  particular  –  insofar  as  the  Contribution  is  a\nsoftware– their\
  \ Source Code and Object Code in any and all forms. The above usage rights include – where\n\
  applicable – design rights.\n\n3 Granting of a patent license\n\n(1)  For any patents (including\
  \ pending patent applications) owned and licensable by the Contributor at\nthe  time  of \
  \ the  submission  of  the  Contribution,  the  Contributor  hereby  grants  the  Open  Logistics\n\
  Foundation and any third party who receives and/or uses a Work containing the Contributions\
  \ or the\nContributions themselves - adapted or not - a\n\n•  perpetual,\n•  worldwide,\n\
  •  non-exclusive,\n•  free of charge,\n•  irrevocable\n\npatent license in all rights deriving\
  \ from the patent to\n\n•  produce,\n•  arrange to have produced,\n•  use,\n•  offer for sale,\n\
  •  sell,\n•  import and otherwise transfer\n\nthe Work or the respective Contributions.\n\n\
  However,  this  patent  license  covers  only  those  rights  deriving  from  the  patent\
  \  of  the  respective\nContributor as are indispensable in order not to infringe that patent\
  \ and only to the extent that the\nuse  of  the  Contributor’s  respective  Contribution,\
  \  whether  in  itself  or  as  a  combination  with  other\nContributions  of  the  Contributor\
  \  or  any  third  parties  together  with  the  Work  for  which  these\nContributions  were\
  \  submitted,  would  otherwise  infringe  that  patent.  For  avoidance  of  doubt,  no\n\
  patent licenses are granted for the use of a Work or the Contribution which become necessary\
  \ for\nlawful use because third party modifications are made to the Work or the respective\
  \ Contribution\nafter the Contribution has been submitted by the Contributor.\n\n(2)  If any\
  \ entity or person institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity or person\
  \ (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution,\
  \ or the Work to which you\nhave contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,\
  \ then any patent licenses\ngranted to that person or entity under this CLA for that Contribution\
  \ or Work shall terminate as of\nthe date such litigation is filed.\n\n(3)  The  Contributor\
  \  is  entitled  to  decide  in  its  own  discretion  to  abandon  respectively  maintain\
  \  any\npatent for which he has granted a patent license in accordance with para. 1 of this\
  \ Section 3.\n\n4 Contributor’s binding representations\n\n(1)  The Contributor hereby represents\
  \ that\n\na.  it is entitled to grant the usage rights and - to the extent applicable - patent\
  \ licenses for\nContributions under this CLA, and\nb.  by  granting  usage  rights  under\
  \  Section 2  above  and  patent  licenses  under  Section 3\nabove, they are not infringing\
  \ any rights granted by the Contributor to third parties.\n\n(2)  If  the  Contributor  wishes\
  \  to  submit  a  third-party  work,  this  must  take  place  separately  from  any\nContribution,\
  \ in which case the complete details of the source and all licenses or other limitations\n\
  (including but not limited to any associated patents, trademarks and licensing agreements)\
  \ which\nthey are personally aware of must be provided. The corresponding work must be clearly\
  \ identified as\na third-party work when it is submitted.\n\n5 Trademarks\n\nThe Contributor\
  \ does not grant permission to use its trade names, trademarks, service marks or product\n\
  names.\n\n6 No restriction on other use by the Contributor\n\nThe  Contributor  is  expressly\
  \  permitted  to  use  and  exploit  the  Contributions  on  a  commercial  or  non–\ncommercial\
  \ basis – individually, in part or as part of another work – in accordance with the rights\
  \ held by\nthe Contributor, provided that such other use or  exploitation does not conflict\
  \  with the rights granted\nunder this CLA.\n\n7 Obligations of the Open Logistics Foundation\n\
  \n(1)  The Open Logistics Foundation is not obliged to incorporate the Contributor’s Contributions\
  \ into any\nWork or to use them in any other way.\n\n(2)  If a Work is distributed by the\
  \ Open Logistics Foundation by way of incorporation of the Contributor’s\nContributions or\
  \ if the Contributions themselves are distributed, the Open Logistics Foundation is\nobliged\
  \  -  irrespective  of  whether  the  Contributions  have  been  modified  by  the  Open \
  \ Logistics\nFoundation or any third party -\n\na.  to retain and to oblige the recipients\
  \ of  the Work to  retain all copyright, patent, trade\nmark and name credit notices in the\
  \ Contributions - in the form as distributed - with the\nexception of those notices that do\
  \ not pertain to any part of the distributed Contributions;\nb.  to grant the Contributor\
  \ a license to the rights in the distributed Work that contains the\nContributor’s Contributions,\
  \ corresponding to Sections 2 and 3 above.\n\n8 Contributor’s assumption of the role of Committer\n\
  \nIf  the  Open  Logistics  Foundation  under  a  separate  agreement  assigns  the  role\
  \  of  a  Committer  to  the\nContributor  and  the  Contributor  accepts  the  role,  the\
  \  Contributor  must  comply  with  the  guidelines,\npolicies and codes of conduct imposed\
  \ as part of the assignment.\n\n9 Limitation of liability\n\nExcept  in  cases  of  intent\
  \  and  gross  negligence,  the  Contributor  shall  not  be  liable  towards  the  Open\n\
  Logistics Foundation for direct or indirect, material or immaterial losses of any kind arising\
  \ from the use\nof  the  Contributions;  this  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  loss \
  \ of  goodwill,  interruption  of  production,\ncomputer failures or errors, loss of data\
  \ or economic losses, even if the Contributor has been made aware\nof the possibility of such\
  \ losses. Notwithstanding the above, the Contributor shall only be liable under\nproduct liability\
  \ law to the extent that the respective provisions are applicable to the Contributions.\n\n\
  Except  in  case  of  intent  or  gross  negligence  the  Contributor  shall  not  be  liable\
  \  that  any  of  the\nContributions is free from any claim of infringement of any patent\
  \ or any other intellectual property right\nowned by any third party, accurate, devoid of\
  \ mistakes, complete and/or usable for any purpose.\n\n10 Other provisions\n\n(1)  This CLA\
  \ is governed by German law, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International\n\
  Sale of Goods (CISG). Exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes between the parties\
  \ regarding\nthe interpretation of this CLA is Dortmund. This CLA or any provision thereof\
  \ may be amended or\nmodified only with the mutual consent of the contracting parties as set\
  \ out in a written instrument.\nThis requirement of written form can only be deviated from\
  \ in writing.\n\n(2)  Any failure by the Open Logistics Foundation or the Contributor to insist\
  \ that the other Party adhere\nto  a  provision  of  this  CLA  in  a  given  situation  does\
  \  not  affect  the  right  of  such  Party  to  require\nadherence in the same regard at\
  \ a later date. Waiving compliance with a provision in one situation\nshall not be deemed\
  \ a waiver of compliance with that provision in the future or as a waiver of the\nprovision\
  \ in its entirety.\n\n(3)  If any provision of this CLA should prove to be invalid and unenforceable,\
  \ then the validity of the\nremaining provisions shall remain unaffected. In this case, that\
  \ provision will be replaced, as far as\npossible, by an enforceable provision that most closely\
  \ reflects the meaning of the original provision.\n\nLocation:\n\nDate: \n\nSignature:\n\n\
