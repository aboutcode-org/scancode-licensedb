  \ 3, 29 June 2007\n \n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\
  \ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document,\
  \ but changing it is not allowed.\n \n\n  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
  \ incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\nLicense,\
  \ supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n \n  0. Additional Definitions.\n\
  \ \n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public\
  \ License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n \n\
  \  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application\
  \ or a Combined Work as defined below.\n \n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use\
  \ of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n\
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface\
  \ provided by the Library.\n \n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking\
  \ an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the\
  \ Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n \n  The \"Minimal Corresponding\
  \ Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding\
  \ any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\n\
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n \n  The \"Corresponding Application\
  \ Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application,\
  \ including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n\
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n \n  1. Exception to\
  \ Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n \n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of\
  \ this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n \n  2. Conveying Modified\
  \ Versions.\n \n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility\
  \ refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other\
  \ than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of\
  \ the modified\nversion:\n \n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith\
  \ effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function\
  \ or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains\
  \ meaningful, or\n \n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n\
  \   this License applicable to that copy.\n \n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from\
  \ Library Header Files.\n \n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material\
  \ from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under\
  \ terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical\
  \ parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and\
  \ templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n \n   a) Give\
  \ prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and\
  \ that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n \n   b) Accompany the object\
  \ code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n \n  4. Combined Works.\n\
  \ \n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively\
  \ do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work\
  \ and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\
  \ \n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is\
  \ used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n \n   b) Accompany\
  \ the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n \n   c) For\
  \ a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright\
  \ notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user\
  \ to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n \n   d) Do one of the following:\n\
  \ \n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License,\
  \ and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that\
  \ permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version\
  \ of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner\
  \ specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n \n \
  \      1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A\
  \ suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already\
  \ present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified\
  \ version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\
  \ \n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required\
  \ to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that\
  \ such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined\
  \ Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of\
  \ the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n\
  \   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option\
  \ 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section\
  \ 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n \n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\
  \ \n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side\
  \ in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and\
  \ are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\n\
  choice, if you do both of the following:\n \n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy\
  \ of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n\
  \   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n \n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined\
  \ library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find\
  \ the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n \n  6. Revised Versions of the\
  \ GNU Lesser General Public License.\n \n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
  \ and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\n\
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address\
  \ new problems or concerns.\n \n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
  \ the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser\
  \ General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following\
  \ the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished\
  \ by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version\
  \ number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU\
  \ Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n \n  If\
  \ the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions\
  \ of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of\
  \ acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for\
  \ the\nLibrary."
