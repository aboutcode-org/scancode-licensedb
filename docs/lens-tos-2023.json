Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, Mirantis provides software and tools for cloud native software development, devops and related purposes (the \u201cLens Software\u201d), centralized cloud services (\u201cLens Cloud\u201d), related support and other services (\u201cLens Services\u201d), provided through and/or marketed at our website at k8slens.dev, including all sub-domains (the \u201cWebsite\u201d). Except to the extent you and Mirantis have executed a separate agreement, these terms and conditions exclusively govern your access to and use of the Lens Software, Lens Cloud, Lens Services and Website (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Mirantis (the \u201cTerms\u201d). These Terms, including all Additional Terms referenced in Section 1.2 below, are, collectively, the \u201cAgreement\u201d. If you accept or agree to the Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or other legal entity (a \u201cLegal Entity\u201d), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Legal Entity to the Agreement and, in such event, \u201cCustomer\u201d \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity. You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing, purchasing or using the Services, you are indicating that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the Agreement whether or not you have created a Lens ID account. If you do not agree to these Terms and all applicable additional terms, then you have no right to access or use any of the Services.\n\n1.2. The Services are subject to additional terms as shown below (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d). For clarity, unless otherwise indicated in specific Additional Terms, Services are provided by Mirantis.\n\n    Lens Desktop Software Additional Terms\n\n    Lens Cloud Services Additional Terms\n\n    1.3.

These features are designed to help provide a great end user experience.\n\n    Automated Lens Software Updates. The Lens Software may automatically communicate with Mirantis servers to determine whether there are updated version(s) of the Lens Software available.
