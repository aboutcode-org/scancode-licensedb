IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This JIDE Software, Inc. (&#34;JIDE&#34;) Software License Agreement (&#34;SLA&#34;) is a legal agreement between you (an individual developer or a company of software applications) and JIDE for the JIDE software product accompanying this SLA, which includes computer software and may include associated source code, media, printed materials, and &#34;on-line&#34; or electronic documentation (&#34;SOFTWARE PRODUCT&#34;). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the terms of this SLA. If you do not agree to the terms of this SLA, do not install, use, distribute in any manner, or replicate in any manner, any part, file or portion of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. 
 
The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold. 
1.	RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. If the licensed right of use for this SOFTWARE PRODUCT is purchased by you with any intent to reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works, and the exploitation or unauthorized transfer of, any JIDE intellectual property and trade secrets, to include any exposed methods or source code where provided, no licensed right of use shall exist, and any products created as a result shall be judged illegal by definition of all applicable law. Any sale or resale of intellectual property or created derivatives so obtained will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all local, federal and international law. 
2.	GRANT OF LICENSE. This SLA, if legally executed as defined herein, licenses and so grants you the following rights: 
A.	Single Developer License. Single Developer License allows an individual developer to use APIs (&#34;Application Programming Interface&#34;) provided by SOFTWARE PRODUCT in any number of projects that he or she is working on. A Single Developer License for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be shared or used by more than one individual developer. In a project that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, each individual developer on the project requires a separate Single Developer License as long as they need to write code using JIDE API. 
B.	Source Code License. In addition to the license and rights granted above, JIDE grants you the right to use and modify the JIDE source provided you licensed source code. Different from developer license, source code license is licensed to a team. Each team only needs to purchase one copy of source code license and share it among those developers who have their own Single Developer License.
I.	JIDE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to all updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works, in whole or in part, of the JIDE Source Code created by you, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such modifications, enhancements or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the JIDE source code; provided, however, that JIDE grants to you a fully-paid, royalty free license, to use copy and modify such updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works or copies thereof for use as authorized in this LICENSE. 
II.	You may not distribute the JIDE source code, or any modified version or derivative work of the JIDE source code, in source code form. 
III.	JIDE require all developers in your project who plan to access JIDE source code signing on the source code license. As long as they signed, they become registered developers. An alternative to this is to let a delegate signs source code license as an organization. The delegate will be responsible for letting other developers who plan to access the source code reviewing this license agreement first before releasing them the access. 
IV.	The source code contained herein and in related files is provided to the registered developer for the purposes of education and troubleshooting. Under no circumstances may any portion of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party without the express written consent of JIDE. 
V.	Under no circumstances may the source code be used in whole or in part, as the basis for creating a product that provides the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any JIDE products. 
VI.	The registered developer acknowledges that this source code contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of JIDE. The registered developer agrees to expend every effort to insure its confidentiality. For example, under no circumstances may the registered developer allow to put the source code on an internal network where he or she has no control.
VII.	Due to the insecurity of Java byte-code, if you plan to use classes that built from the source code directly, you must agree to obfuscate the classes before distributing it to your customers. 
VIII.	SOURCE CODE IS SOLD AS IS. JIDE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR SOURCE CODE. 
C.	Annual Maintenance Renewal. Maintenance includes both technical support and product updates. The initial purchase of Single Developer License includes three month maintenance for free. After that period, you need to purchase Annual Maintenance Renewal in order to continue receiving technical support, product updates.
D.	Deployment License. There is no deployment license fee unless the number of your application deployments is larger than 1000 times of the number of developer licenses you purchased and you are unwilling to acknowledge using JIDE. You can acknowledge using JIDE by showing JIDE name and/or logo in about dialog, or splash screen or including this SLA in a license folder of your product release where has the licenses for all 3rd party libraries you are using or any other places where users can easily notice. If you are unwilling to acknowledge using JIDE, a one-time, perpetual deployment license fee will be applicable.
