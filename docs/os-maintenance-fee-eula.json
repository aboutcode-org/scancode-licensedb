  "text": "End User License Agreement\n\nThis Open Source Maintenance Fee Agreement (\"Agreement\") is a legal agreement\nbetween you (\"User\") and <PROJECTNAME> (\"Project\") for the use of\n<SOFTWARENAME> (\"Software\"), an open source software project licensed under\nthe <OSILICENSE> (\"OSI License\"), an OSI-approved open source license.\nProject offers a Binary Release of the Software to Users in exchange for a\nmaintenance fee (\"Fee\"). \"Binary Release\" refers to pre-compiled executable\nversions of the Software provided by Project. By accessing or using the\nBinary Release, User agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n\n1. Applicability\n\nProject agrees to provide User with the Binary Release in exchange for the\nFees outlined in Section 2, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Fee\napplies only to Users that generate revenue by the Software.\nNon-revenue-generating use of the Software is exempt from this Fee. In\naddition, Users who pay separate support and/or maintenance fees to the\nmaintainers of the Software are exempt from the Fee outlined in this\nAgreement. This distinction ensures that duplicate fees are not imposed,\npromoting fairness and consistency while respecting alternative support\narrangements.\n\n2. Monthly Fee and Payment Terms\n\nRevenue-generating Users required to pay the Fee shall follow the payment\nterms set forth by the Project. Failure to comply with these terms may result\nin suspending access to the Binary Release. However, this does not restrict\nthe User from obtaining or redistributing binaries from other sources or\nself-compiling them.\n\n3. Nature of the Fee\n\nThe Fee is not a license fee. The Software's source code is licensed to User\nunder the OSI License and remains freely distributable under the terms of the\nOSI License and any applicable open-source licenses.\n\n4. Conflicts with OSI License\n\nTo the extent any term of this Agreement conflicts with User's rights\nunder the OSI License regarding the Software, the OSI License shall govern.\nThis Agreement applies only to the Binary Release and does not limit User's\nability to access, modify, or distribute the Software's source code or\nself-compiled binaries. User may independently compile binaries from the\nSoftware's source code without this Agreement, subject to OSI License terms.\nUser may redistribute the Binary Release received under this Agreement,\nprovided such redistribution complies with the OSI License (e.g., including\ncopyright and permission notices). This Agreement imposes no additional\nrestrictions on such rights.\n\n5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability\n\nTHE SOFTWARE AND BINARY RELEASE ARE PROVIDED BY THE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROJECT OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR\nANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR\nSERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER\nCAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,\nOR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE\nOF THE SOFTWARE AND BINARY RELEASE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGE."
