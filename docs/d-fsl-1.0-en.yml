text: "German Free Software License\n\n(c) Ministry of Science and Research, State of \nNorth-Rhine\
  \ Westphalia 2004\n\nDeveloped and created by Axel Metzger and Till \nJaeger, Institut f√ºr\
  \ Rechtsfragen der Freien und \nOpen Source Software (Institute for Legal Issues \nOn Free\
  \ and Open Source Software), \n<http://www.ifross.de>.\n\nPreamble\n\nSoftware is more than\
  \ a mere economic asset. It \nis the technical foundation of the information \nsociety. Therefore,\
  \ the issue of the public share \nin software is of particular importance. \nConventionally\
  \ licensed computer programs are \ndistributed in object code form only, and the \nuser is\
  \ not entitled to modify or pass on the \nprogram to third parties. The license model for\
  \ \nFree Software (synonym \"Open Source Software\"), \nhowever, grants comprehensive rights\
  \ in the \nhandling of the program. The German Free Software \nLicense is based on this license\
  \ model. It gives \nyou the right to use the program in a \ncomprehensive manner. You are\
  \ allowed to modify \nthe computer program according to your \nrequirements or to reproduce\
  \ or distribute it and \nmake it publicly available in a modified or \nunmodified form. These\
  \ rights are granted free of \ncharge. \n\nHowever, the German Free Software License \ncombines\
  \ these rights with certain obligations \nthat will ensure the free circulation of the \n\
  program and all further developments published. \nIf you distribute the program or make it\
  \ publicly \navailable, you have to include a copy of this \nlicense to anyone receiving the\
  \ program from you \nand enable access to its source code. Another \nobligation arises from\
  \ further developments of \nthe program. Modifications to the program which \nyou distribute\
  \ or make publicly available shall \nbe released in accordance with the conditions of \nthis\
  \ license. \n\nGerman Free Software License takes into account \nthe special requirements\
  \ of German and European \nlaw. It is drafted bilingually and thus intended \nfor international\
  \ distribution. \n\n\nSection 0 Definitions\n\nDocumentation: Description of composition,\
  \ \narchitecture and/or structure of the programming \nprocess and/or functionalities of the\
  \ program, \nirrespective of whether they were done in the \nSource Code or separately.\n\n\
  License: The agreement concluded between the \nlicensor and you, with the content of the German\
  \ \nFree Software License and/or the pertaining \noffer. \n\nLicensee: Every natural or legal\
  \ entity who has \naccepted this License.\n\nProgram: Every computer program which has been\
  \ \ndistributed or made publicly available by the \nentitled person in accordance with the\
  \ terms of \nthis License.\n\nObject Code: The machine-readable form of the \nProgram.\n\n\
  Public/publicly: Not solely directed towards a \ncertain group of people who have a personal\
  \ \nconnection to each other or are associated \nthrough their affiliation with a legal person\
  \ or \npublic organisation.\n\nMaking Publicly Available: The public \ndistribution of the\
  \ Program in an immaterial \nform, in particular, by making it available for \ndownload in\
  \ data networks.  \n\nEntitled Person(s): The author(s) or other \nholders of the exclusive\
  \ right to use for the \nProgram.\n\nSource Code: The form of the Program represented \nin\
  \ programming language and readable for humans.\n\nModification: Any extension, shortening\
  \ and/or \nalteration of the Program, including, but not \nlimited to further developments.\n\
  \nDistribution: The public passing on of material \ncopies to third parties, in particular,\
  \ onto \nstorage devices or in connection with hardware.  \n\nComplete Source Code: The Source\
  \ Code in the form \nused for preparation and/or modification together \nwith the configuration\
  \ files and software tools \nrequired for compilation and installation, \nprovided that these\
  \ are not commonly used in the \nrequired form (e.g. standard compiler) or can be \ndownloaded\
  \ by any Internet user without license \nfee.\n\n\nSection 1 Rights\n\n(1) You may reproduce\
  \ and distribute the Program \nand make it publicly available in an unmodified \nform. \n\n\
  (2) You may modify the Program and reproduce and \ndistribute modified versions and make them\
  \ \npublicly available. It is also permitted to \ncombine the Program or parts thereof with\
  \ other \nprograms. \n\n(3) You obtain the rights free of charge.\n\n\nSection 2 Obligations\
  \ for Distribution and Making \nPublicly Available\n\n(1) If you distribute the Program or\
  \ make it \npublicly available, be it in unmodified or \nmodified form, be it in combination\
  \ with other \nprograms or in connection with hardware, you also \nhave to provide or include\
  \ the following:\n\n1. all references to this License in the Source \nCode and/or Object Code;\n\
  \ \n2. all references in the Source Code and/or \nObject Code containing information about\
  \ the \nauthor of the Program;\n\n3. a conspicuous reference to this License and \nthe Internet\
  \ address <http://www.d-fsl.org>, to \nbe displayed in a form that can easily be read by \n\
  the recipient;\n\n4. the complete text of this License in a form \neasy to perceive.\n\n(2)\
  \ If license and/or contract terms are \ndisplayed when the Program is installed and/or \n\
  started, the following items must also be \ndisplayed:\n\n1. this License;\n\n2. a reference\
  \ to this License; and\n\n3. a reference to the Entitled Person(s) to the \ninitial program\
  \ components used under this \nLicense.\n\n(3) You may not make the use of the Program \n\
  contingent upon the compliance with conditions or \nobligations that are not set forth in\
  \ this \nLicense. \n\n(4) Provided that you have received Documentation \nfor the Program,\
  \ you have to deliver this \nDocumentation with the Program, as well, unless \nfree delivery\
  \ of the Documentation is not \npermitted by the documentation license.\n\n\nSection 3 Further\
  \ Obligations regarding the \nDistribution of Modified Versions \n\n(1) You may only distribute\
  \ modified versions of \nthe Program or make them publicly available in \naccordance with\
  \ the terms of this License, so \nthat any third party is able to make use of the \nmodified\
  \ Program as a whole under this License. \n\n(2) If the Program or a part thereof is combined\
  \ \nwith another program, this also applies to the \nentire combination as a modified version\
  \ of the \nProgram, unless the other program is independent \nin terms of form and content.\
  \  Another program \nshall be regarded as independent if it fulfils \nthe following requirements:\n\
  \n1. The Source Code of the combined programs must \nbe contained in separate files which\
  \ do not \ninclude components of the other part except for \nparts containing the information\
  \ customary and \nrequired for the Program combination. The Source \nCode of the other program\
  \ does not have to be \ndelivered.\n\n2. The part which is combined with the Program \nmust\
  \ also be reasonably usable when not combined \nwith the Program, i.e. on a standalone basis\
  \ or \nwith other programs. The meaning of \"reasonably \nusable\" will be based on the opinion\
  \ of pertinent \ncircles of expert groups in the relevant field. \nSuch circles of experts\
  \ include everyone who \ndevelops, uses, distributes or makes publicly \navailable the Program\
  \ concerned or programs with \nsimilar functionality.\n\n(3) If you distribute or make publicly\
  \ available \nthe Program or parts thereof - modified or \nunmodified - in combination with\
  \ another program \nlicensed under the GNU General Public License \n(GPL), the Program may\
  \ also be used under \nconditions of the GPL, provided it constitutes a \n\"derivative work\"\
  \ together with the other program \nin the sense of the GPL. In this case, any \nreference\
  \ to this License should be removed and \nreplaced by a reference to the GPL. Whether a \n\
  \"derivative work\" in the sense of the GPL arises \nfrom this combination is primarily defined\
  \ in \nsection 2 b) of the GPL. This provision reads: \n\"You must cause any work that you\
  \ distribute or \npublish, that in whole or in part contains or is \nderived from the Program\
  \ or any part thereof, to \nbe licensed as a whole at no charge to all third \nparties under\
  \ the terms of this License.\" The GPL \ncan be obtained under \n<http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl>.\n\
  \n(4) If you distribute the Program or make it \npublicly available in a modified form, you\
  \ must \ninclude a reference to the modifications and the \ndate of the modification in the\
  \ Source Code. This \nreference must reveal which modifications were \ncarried out and include\
  \ existing references \ncontaining information on the author of the \nProgram. This applies\
  \ to whether or not you add \nyour own copyright notice. Instead of a reference \nin the Source\
  \ Code you may also use or carry on a \nversion control system, provided this is also \ndistributed\
  \ or made publicly available. \n\n(5) You may not charge any third party for the \ngranting\
  \ of the non-exclusive rights of use for \nthe Program.\n\n(6) If you acquire any other intellectual\
  \ or \nindustrial property right to this Program apart \nfrom a copyright, in particular a\
  \ patent or \nutility model, you license this intellectual or \nindustrial property right\
  \ for modified or \nunmodified versions of the Program to the extent \nthat is necessary to\
  \ make due use of the rights \narising from this License. \n\n\nSection 4 Further Obligations\
  \ for the \nDistribution of the Object Code\n\n(1) If you distribute the Program in Object\
  \ Code \nform only, apart from the obligations defined in \nSections 2 and 3, you have to\
  \ either:\n\n1. make the Complete Source Code publicly \navailable in the Internet and - when\
  \ distributing \nthe Object Code - make a clear reference to the \ncomplete Internet address\
  \ from which the Source \nCode can be downloaded; or\n\n2.  distribute the Complete Source\
  \ Code on a \ncustomary data carrier, taking into consideration \nSections 2 and 3.\n\n(2)\
  \ If you make the Program publicly available in \nObject Code form, apart from the obligations\
  \ \ndefined in Sections 2 and 3 you must also make \nthe Complete Source Code publicly available\
  \ in \nthe Internet and make a clear reference to the \ncomplete Internet address.\n\n(3)\
  \ Provided that you have received the \nDocumentation for the Program, you have to \ndeliver\
  \ this Documentation together with the \nProgram in accordance with Subsections 1 and 2, \n\
  as well, unless free delivery of the \nDocumentation is not permitted by the \ndocumentation\
  \ license.\n\n\nSection 5 Conclusion of the Contract\n\n(1) With this License you and any\
  \ other person \nare offered the conclusion of a contract for the \nuse of this Program under\
  \ the conditions of this \nLicense.\n\n(2) You may use the Program in accordance with \nthe\
  \ applicable statutory provisions for the \nintended purpose without having to accept this\
  \ \nLicense. In the European Union and in most other \nlegal systems, this right in particular\
  \ includes \nthe following authorizations: \n\n1. Running of the Program as well as reproducing\
  \ \non hard-drive and RAM  required for this;\n\n2. Making of a back-up copy;\n\n3. Correcting\
  \ errors;\n\n4. Distributing a lawfully acquired physical copy \nof the Program.\n \n(3) You\
  \ declare your acceptance of this License \nby distributing the Program, making it publicly\
  \ \navailable, modifying or reproducing it in a way \nthat goes beyond the intended use in\
  \ the sense of \nSubsection 2. From this time on, this License \nshall be deemed as a legally\
  \ binding agreement \nbetween the Entitled Persons and you, without the \nneed for the Entitled\
  \ Persons to obtain a \ndeclaration of acceptance.\n\n(4) You and any other licensee acquire\
  \ the rights \narising from this License directly from the \nEntitled Persons. Any sub-licensing\
  \ or transfer \nof rights is not permitted.\n \n\nSection 6 Termination of Rights in the Event\
  \ of \nViolations\n\n(1) Any violation of your obligations under this \nLicense automatically\
  \ leads to the termination of \nyour rights under this License. \n\n(2) Any rights of third\
  \ parties having obtained \nthe Program or rights to the Program from you \nshall remain unaffected.\
  \ \n\n\nSection 7 Liability and Warranty\n\n(1) The Entitled Persons are only liable for \n\
  conflicting third-party rights if they were aware \nof such rights without informing you.\n\
  \n(2) Liability for errors and/or other defects in \nthe Program shall be governed by agreements\
  \ \nconcluded between you and the Entitled Person \nbeyond the scope of this License or, if\
  \ no such \nagreement exists, by the pertinent statutory \nprovisions.  \n\n\nSection 8 Agreements\
  \ with Third Parties\n\n(1) This License only governs the relationship \nbetween you and the\
  \ Entitled Persons. It is not \npart of agreements between you and third parties. \n\n(2)\
  \ This License does not limit your freedom to \nconclude agreements of any content whatsoever\
  \ \nwith third parties obtaining copies of the \nProgram from you or purchasing services from\
  \ you \nin connection with the Program, provided that you \nfulfil your obligations under\
  \ this License and \nthird-party rights under this License are not \ninfringed. In particular,\
  \ you may charge a fee as \nconsideration for the transfer of the Program or \nother services.\
  \  \n\n(3) This License does not commit you to forward \nthe Program to a third party. You\
  \ are free to \ndecide to whom you wish to make the Program \navailable. However, you may\
  \ not prevent or \ncomplicate further use by third parties through \nthe use of technical\
  \ protective measures, in \nparticular, the use of copy protection of any \nkind. Password-protected\
  \ access restriction or \nuse in an Intranet shall not be regarded as \ntechnical protective\
  \ measures.\n\n\nSection 9 Text of the License\n\n(1) This License is written in German and\
  \ \nEnglish. Both versions are equally binding. It is \nassumed that terminology used in the\
  \ License has \nthe same meaning in both versions. Should, \nhowever, differences arise, such\
  \ meaning is \nauthoritative which best brings into line both \nversions, taking into consideration\
  \ the aim and \npurpose of the License. \n\n(2) The license board of the German Free Software\
  \ \nLicense may put into force binding new versions \nof this License inasmuch as this is\
  \ required and \nreasonable. New versions of the License will be \npublished on the Internet\
  \ site <http://www.d-\nfsl.org> with a unique version number. The new \nversion of the License\
  \ becomes binding for you as \nsoon as you become aware of its publication. \nLegal remedies\
  \ against the modification of the \nLicense are not restricted by the regulations \ndescribed\
  \ above. \n\n(3) You may reproduce and distribute this License \nand make it publicly available\
  \ in an unmodified \nform. \n\n\nSection 10 Applicable Law\n\nThe License is governed by German\
  \ law.\n\n\nAppendix: How to submit a Program to the German \nFree Software License.\n\nIn\
  \ order to make it possible for anyone to \nconclude this License, it is recommended to \n\
  include the following reference to the License in \nthe Program:\n\n\"Copyright (C) 20[yy]\
  \ [Name of the Entitled \nPerson]. \n\nThis Program may be used by anyone in accordance \n\
  with the terms of the German Free Software \nLicense\n\nThe License may be obtained under\
  \ <http://www.d-fsl.org>.\""
