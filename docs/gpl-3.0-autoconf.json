It applies to a given file\nthat bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating\nthat the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nThe purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's\ntypical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including\nproprietary).\n\n0. Definitions.\n\"Covered Code\" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf\nthat is a covered work under this License.\n\n\"Normally Copied Code\" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its\nCovered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from\nits input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-\ntracing output.\n\n\"Ineligible Code\" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by\nmodifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you\nreceived to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then\nyou void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey\nthat resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in\naccordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.\n\n2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of Autoconf."
