License, OFRAK Enterprise License or a custom agreement.  Below are the details
regarding use of OFRAK. Note: As of August 2022, and for a limited period,
OFRAK Pro Licenses are available at no cost.  RED BALLOON SECURITY, INC. (“RED
BALLOON”) IS ONLY WILLING TO LICENSE OFRAK AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION PURSUANT
TO THIS AGREEMENT.  READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING AND
INSTALLING AND USING OFRAK.  BY ACCESSING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE
USING OFRAK, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND YOUR
EMPLOYER/INSTITUTION (“YOU”) TO BE BOUND TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT CREATES A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT AND
CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT
MODIFICATION.  YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT
ON YOUR EMPLOYER’S BEHALF.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND
CONDITIONS, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY OR USE OFRAK.

1.2	“Academic Purposes” means use within a non-profit academic institution
by its then-current faculty and students for the purposes of non-profit
scholarly research, classroom and education, and not any other use (including
without limitation, directly or indirectly in connection with any commercial
activity such as, for example, sponsored research or consulting services).
Shared Use of OFRAK for an Academic Purpose is permitted only when (a) used for
educational purposes, (b) access is restricted and not provided to the general
public, (c) access is limited to employees and/or students of the same
institution involved in a specific educational activity, and (d) all users

1.3	“Non-Commercial Use” means personal research, evaluation, or
development use by an individual, and not use by or on behalf of any commercial
entity or organization or directly or indirectly in connection with any
commercial activity.  For clarity, you cannot make money off of redistributing
OFRAK code (including Derivatives), OFRAK analysis, OFRAK-modified binaries, or
other OFRAK outputs.  Non-Commercial Use also excludes any Shared Use.
  
1.4	“Commercial Use” means any use other than Academic Purposes or
Non-Commercial Use, including, without limitation, use for any commercial
purpose or by any commercial entity, including without limitation

commercial consideration.

1.5	“Derivatives” means any modifications, additions, enhancements, or
derivative works of OFRAK or any component thereof.  For purposes of this
Agreement, Derivatives shall not include works that remain separable from, or
merely link to, the interfaces of OFRAK or any Derivatives.

1.6	“Shared Use” means  any use of OFRAK where the person who set up a
particular instance of OFRAK is not the same person interacting with that
instance of OFRAK, or where a single instance of OFRAK is used by more than one
person (whether on the same or different occasions). This includes, but is not
limited to, the use of OFRAK on a server that is accessible by more than one
person, or by any person other than the person who set up the use of OFRAK on
the said server.

commercialize, distribute or use OFRAK, Derivatives, OFRAK code, OFRAK
analysis, OFRAK-modified binaries, or other OFRAK outputs for any other purpose
whatsoever, including Commercial Use, other than Academic Purposes or

sufficient rights to any Derivatives and are legally entitled to grant the
above rights and licenses. If you are an individual and your

Derivatives, subject to the rights and licenses granted herein, you retain
ownership of all right, title and interest in and to such Derivatives,

suffered or incurred by such party which arise from or relate to your (i) use
of OFRAK or Derivatives, or (ii) breach of this Agreement.

12.	Miscellaneous.  Neither this Agreement nor the licenses granted
hereunder are assignable or transferable by you; any attempt to do so shall be
void.  Red Balloon may assign this Agreement in whole or in part.  Any notice,
report, approval or consent required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing.  The provisions hereof are for the benefit of the parties only and not
for any other person or entity. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid,
that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
enforceable.  This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
construed pursuant to the laws of the State of New York, without regard to
conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations
Convention on the International Sale of Goods or the Uniform Computer
Information Transactions Act. Any waivers or amendments shall be effective only
