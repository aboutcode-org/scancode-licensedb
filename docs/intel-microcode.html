DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, COPY, OR USE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE 
UNTIL YOU HAVE READ AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY 
INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY 
BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. If You do not agree to be 
bound by, or the entity for whose benefit You act has not authorized You to 
accept, these terms and conditions, do not install, access, copy, or use the 
Software and destroy all copies of the Software in Your possession. 

This SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (this &#34;Agreement&#34;) is entered into between 
Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#34;Intel&#34;) and You. &#34;You&#34; refers to 
you or your employer or other entity for whose benefit you act, as applicable. 
If you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of 
a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the 
legal authority to bind that legal entity to the Agreement, in which case, 
&#34;You&#34; or &#34;Your&#34; shall be in reference to such entity. Intel and You are 
referred to herein individually as a &#34;Party&#34; or, together, as the &#34;Parties&#34;.
The Parties, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this 
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and 
sufficiency of which they acknowledge, and intending to be legally bound, agree 
as follows:  

1. PURPOSE. You seek to obtain, and Intel desires to provide You, under the 
terms of this Agreement, Software solely for Your efforts to develop and 
distribute products integrating Intel hardware and Intel software. &#34;Software&#34; 
refers to certain software or other collateral, including, but not limited to, 
related components, operating system, application program interfaces, device 
drivers, associated media, printed or electronic documentation and any updates, 
upgrades or releases thereto associated with Intel product(s), software or 
service(s). &#34;Intel-based product&#34; refers to a device that includes, 
incorporates, or implements Intel product(s), software or service(s).

2. LIMITED LICENSE. Conditioned on Your compliance with the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to You a limited, nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, revocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license during the term of 
this Agreement, without the right to sublicense, under Intel&#39;s copyrights 
(subject to any third party licensing requirements), to (i) reproduce the 
Software only for Your own internal evaluation, testing, validation, and 
development of Intel-based products and any associated maintenance thereof; 
(ii) reproduce, display, and publicly perform an object code representation of 
the Software, only when integrated with and executed by an Intel-based product, 
subject to any third party licensing requirements; and (iii) distribute an 
object code representation of the Software, provided by Intel, through multiple 
levels of distribution, solely as embedded in or for execution on an 
Intel-based product and subject to these license terms, and if to an end user, 
pursuant to a license agreement with terms and conditions at least as 
restrictive as those contained in the Intel End User Software License Agreement 
in Appendix A hereto.

If You are not the final manufacturer or vendor of an Intel-based product 
incorporating or designed to incorporate the Software, You may transfer a copy 
of the Software to Your Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Original Device 
Manufacturer (ODM), distributors, or system integration partners (&#34;Your 
Partner&#34;) for use in accordance with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, provided Your Partner agrees to be fully bound by the terms hereof 
and provided that You will remain fully liable to Intel for the actions and 
inactions of Your Partner(s).

3. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. All right, title and interest in and to the Software 
and associated documentation are and will remain the exclusive property of 
Intel and its licensors or suppliers. Unless expressly permitted under the 
Agreement, You will not, and will not allow any third party to (i) use, copy, 
distribute, sell or offer to sell the Software or associated documentation; 
(ii) modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, change 
or create derivative works from the Software except and only to the extent as 
specifically required by mandatory applicable laws or any applicable third 
party license terms accompanying the Software; (iii) use or make the Software 
available for the use or benefit of third parties; or (iv) use the Software on 
Your products other than those that include the Intel hardware product(s), 
platform(s), or software identified in the Software; or (v) publish or provide 
any Software benchmark or comparison test results. You acknowledge that an 
essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that Intel grants You no 
licenses or other rights including, but not limited to, patent, copyright, 
trade secret, trademark, trade name, service mark or other intellectual 
property licenses or rights with respect to the Software and associated 
documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses 
expressly granted above. You acknowledge there are significant uses of the 
Software in its original, unmodified and uncombined form. You may not remove 
any copyright notices from the Software.

4. LICENSE TO FEEDBACK. This Agreement does not obligate You to provide Intel 
with materials, information, comments, suggestions, or other communication 
regarding the features, functions, performance or use of the Software 
(&#34;Feedback&#34;). If any portion of the Software is provided or otherwise made 
available by Intel in source code form, to the extent You provide Intel with 
Feedback in a tangible form, You grant to Intel and its affiliates a 
non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, 
fully paid-up and transferable license, to and under all of Your intellectual 
property rights, whether perfected or not, to publicly perform, publicly 
display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute, 
import, create derivative works of and otherwise exploit any comments, 
suggestions, descriptions, ideas, Your Derivatives or other feedback regarding 
the Software provided by You or on Your behalf.

5. OPEN SOURCE STATEMENT. The Software may include Open Source Software (OSS) 
licensed pursuant to OSS license agreement(s) identified in the OSS comments in 
the applicable source code file(s) or file header(s) provided with or otherwise 
associated with the Software. Neither You nor any OEM, ODM, customer, or 
distributor may subject any proprietary portion of the Software to any OSS 
license obligations including, without limitation, combining or distributing 
the Software with OSS in a manner that subjects Intel, the Software or any 
portion thereof to any OSS license obligation. Nothing in this Agreement limits 
any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable 
OSS license. 

6. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Certain third party software provided with or within 
the Software may only be used (a) upon securing a license directly from the 
owner of the software or (b) in combination with hardware components purchased 
from such third party and (c) subject to further license limitations by the 
software owner. A listing of any such third party limitations is in one or more 
text files accompanying the Software. You acknowledge Intel is not providing 
You with a license to such third party software and further that it is Your 
responsibility to obtain appropriate licenses from such third parties directly.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, exchanged 
confidential information, as well as the Software are subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement(s) or Intel Pre-Release Loan 
Agreement(s) (referred to herein collectively or individually as &#34;NDA&#34;) entered 
into by and in force between Intel and You, and in any case no less 
confidentiality protection than You apply to Your information of similar 
sensitivity. If You would like to have a contractor perform work on Your behalf 
that requires any access to or use of Software, You must obtain a written 
confidentiality agreement from the contractor which contains terms and 
conditions with respect to access to or use of Software no less restrictive 
than those set forth in this Agreement, excluding any distribution rights and 
use for any other purpose, and You will remain fully liable to Intel for the 
actions and inactions of those contractors. You may not use Intel&#39;s name in any 
publications, advertisements, or other announcements without Intel&#39;s prior 
written consent. 

8. NO OBLIGATION; NO AGENCY. Intel may make changes to the Software, or items 
referenced therein, at any time without notice. Intel is not obligated to 
support, update, provide training for, or develop any further version of the 
Software or to grant any license thereto. No agency, franchise, partnership, 
joint-venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this 
Agreement.

9. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT ANY 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Intel 
does not warrant or assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of 
any information, text, graphics, links or other items within the Software.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL INTEL OR ITS AFFILIATES, 
LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, 
EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST DATA) ARISING OUT OF 
OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY 
IN PART NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER IS NOT DESIGNED OR 
INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING OR LIFE SUSTAINING SYSTEMS, 
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, NUCLEAR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER MISSION CRITICAL 
APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD TO PERSONAL INJURY 
OR DEATH. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO 
JURISDICTION. THE LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY 
ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND YOU. YOU 
ACKNOWLEDGE INTEL WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH 
LIMITATIONS. YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD INTEL AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS 
AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND 
AGENTS) HARMLESS AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, DAMAGES, AND 
EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES), ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY CLAIM OF PRODUCT 
LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF 
SUCH CLAIM ALLEGES THAT INTEL OR AN INTEL AFFILIATE, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIER WAS 
NEGLIGENT REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE SOFTWARE.

11. TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL. Intel may terminate this Agreement for any reason 
with thirty (30) days&#39; notice and immediately if You or someone acting on Your 
behalf or at Your behest violates any of its terms or conditions. Upon 
termination, You will immediately destroy and ensure the destruction of the 
Software or return all copies of the Software to Intel (including providing 
certification of such destruction or return back to Intel). Upon termination of 
this Agreement, all licenses granted to You hereunder terminate immediately. 
All Sections of this Agreement, except Section 2, will survive termination. 

12. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. This Agreement and any dispute arising out 
of or relating to it will be governed by the laws of the U.S.A. and Delaware, 
without regard to conflict of laws principles. The Parties exclude the 
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale of Goods (1980). The state and federal courts sitting in Delaware, U.S.A. 
will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to 
this Agreement. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those 
courts. A Party that obtains a judgment against the other Party in the courts 
identified in this section may enforce that judgment in any court that has 
jurisdiction over the Parties. 

13. EXPORT REGULATIONS/EXPORT CONTROL. You agree that neither You nor Your 
subsidiaries will export/re-export the Software, directly or indirectly, to any 
country for which the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other agency or 
department of the U.S. Government or the foreign government from where it is 
shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without 
first obtaining any such required license or approval. In the event the 
Software is exported from the U.S.A. or re-exported from a foreign destination 
by You or Your subsidiary, You will ensure that the distribution and 
export/re-export or import of the Software complies with all laws, regulations, 
orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and 
the appropriate foreign government. 

14. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Software is a commercial item (as defined 
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101) consisting of commercial computer software and commercial 
computer software documentation (as those terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, 
You will not provide the Software to the U.S. Government. Contractor or 
Manufacturer is Intel Corporation, 2200 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 
95054. 

15. ASSIGNMENT. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the 
license(s) granted or any of Your rights or duties hereunder, expressly, by 
implication, by operation of law, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, 
without Intel&#39;s express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may 
assign, delegate and transfer this Agreement, and its rights and obligations 
hereunder, in its sole discretion. 

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement 
and any NDA with Intel constitute the entire agreement between the parties with 
respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge and supersede all prior or 
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. 
Neither Party will be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, 
understandings, or representations with respect to the subject matter hereof 
other than as expressly provided herein. In the event any provision of this 
Agreement is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or applicable 
court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this 
Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, instead such provision will be 
changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such 
provision within legal limits. 

17. WAIVER. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of 
any provision hereof will not affect the full right to require such performance 
at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision 
hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself. 

18. PRIVACY. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE SET FORTH IN INTEL&#39;S PRIVACY NOTICE, WHICH 
FORMS A PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. PLEASE REVIEW THE PRIVACY NOTICE AT 
HTTP://WWW.INTEL.COM/PRIVACY TO LEARN HOW INTEL COLLECTS, USES AND SHARES 
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.
