In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions.
&#34;Account&#34; refers to the billing account for the Service. All Profiles linked to a single Property will have their Hits aggregated before determining the charge for the Service for that Property.

&#34;Confidential Information&#34; includes any proprietary data and any other information disclosed by one party to the other in writing and marked &#34;confidential&#34; or disclosed orally and, within five business days, reduced to writing and marked &#34;confidential&#34;. However, Confidential Information will not include any information that is or becomes known to the general public, which is already in the receiving party&#39;s possession prior to disclosure by a party or which is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of Confidential Information.

&#34;Customer Data&#34; means the data concerning the characteristics and activities of Visitors that is collected through use of the GATC and then forwarded to the Servers and analyzed by the Processing Software.

Hits may also be delivered to the Google Analytics system without using one of the various libraries by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms the Service makes available to You.

&#34;Processing Software&#34; means the Google Analytics server-side software and any upgrades, which analyzes the Customer Data and generates the Reports.

&#34;Profile&#34; means the collection of settings that together determine the information to be included in, or excluded from, a particular Report. For example, a Profile could be established to view a small portion of a web site as a unique Report. There can be multiple Profiles established under a single Property.

&#34;Property&#34; means a group of web pages or apps that are linked to an Account and use the same GATC. Each Property includes a default Profile that measures all pages within the Property.

&#34;Servers&#34; means the servers controlled by Google (or its wholly owned subsidiaries) on which the Processing Software and Customer Data are stored.

&#34;Software&#34; means the GATC and the Processing Software.

16. Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Venue.
Google will be excused from performance in this Agreement to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control. This Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing) represents the complete agreement between You and Google concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and California law, rules, and regulations, California law, rules and regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

The Software is controlled by U.S. Export Regulations, and it may be not be exported to or used by embargoed countries or individuals.

A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights in this Agreement without Google&#39;s prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. The relationship between Google and You is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The following sections of this Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1, 4, 5, 6 (except the last two sentences), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16.</code></pre>
