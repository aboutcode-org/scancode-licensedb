* **2.3** Unless authorised by the Licensor in writing, the Software may be used

        that generates income or commercial profits.

* **2.4** This License does not govern any commercial use of the Software, as

  included in the Software.

* **2.8**  The Licensee is permitted to load and run the Software on any device,

  is solely responsible for assessing the compatibility of the Devices to be

* **4.1**  All title and copyright in and to the Software (including, but not
  limited to, any source code, images, graphics, photographs, animations, video,
  audio, music, text, and applets, incorporated in the Software) are owned by
  the Licensor. The Software is protected by the English copyright laws and
  international treaties. The Licensee is not allowed to incorporate any portion
  of the Software into other programs or compile any portion of it in

  authorisation from the Licensor, to use the trade names, trademarks, service
  marks or product names of the Licensor, except as required for the use of the

  being subject to the rights of third parties, in particular that its use does
  not infringe patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of
  third parties. However, the Licensor does not guarantee that the Software is
  not subject to the rights of third parties. The Licensee agrees to notify the
  Licensor immediately and in writing if any third party asserts an infringement
  claim against the Licensee in connection with the Software.

* **4.4**  By submitting any content through the Software (the &#34;Licensee&#39;s
  Content&#34;), the Licensee grants  the Licensor unrestricted, sub-licensable,
  royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable rights to process the Licensee&#39;s
  Content for the purposes of providing the Licensee with the Software and
  carrying out Licensor&#39;s legitimate business interests.

* **4.5** The Licensee is not permitted to remove any copyright or other
  proprietary notices and legends.

# 5. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

* **5.1** The Licensor does not have access in any manner to the Licensee&#39;s
  Content. Therefore, the Licensee is solely responsible for creating, keeping
  and maintaining any backup copies of any Licensee&#39;s Content or other
  information submitted to, through, or in relation to the Software.

The Parties agree to individually comply with the applicable data protection
laws pertaining to the Software.

# 6. AVAILABILITY

* **6.1**  The availability of the Software may be affected by factors, which
  the Licensor cannot reasonably control, such as bandwidth problems, equipment
  failure, acts and omissions of our third-party service providers, or *force
  majeure* events. The Licensor takes no responsibility for the unavailability
  of the Software caused by such factors.

# 7. Limitation of liability and disclaimer of warranties

* **7.1**  To the extent permitted by the applicable law, the Licensor expressly
  disclaims all warranties, express or implied, for the Software. The Licensor
  provides the Software on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
  ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
  warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The entire risk arising out of use or
  performance of the Software remains with the Licensee.

* **7.2**  In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any damages whatsoever
  (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business
  interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss)
  arising out of the Licensee&#39;s Content, the use of or inability to use the
  Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
  damages.

* **7.3**  The Licensee is solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of the Software and assumes any risks associated with
  Licensee&#39;s exercise of permissions under the License.

* **7.4**  Third-party content or services are not covered by this License. The
  Licensee shall ensure Licensee&#39;s compliance with any terms set forth by the
  respective third parties at its own risk, cost and expense.  To the maximum
  extent permitted by law, the Licensor excludes any liability for any loss or
  damage resulting from the acts and omissions of such third-party service
  providers.

# 8. Governing Law AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

* 8.1  This License and any disputes arising out of or in connection with the
  License and the Software shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
  the laws of France. Unless otherwise provided by the applicable law, all
  disputes arising out of or in connection with the License shall be submitted
  to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in London, the United Kingdom.

# 9. FINAL PROVISIONS

* **9.1**  **Indemnification.** The Licensee shall indemnify the Licensor at
  Licensee&#39;s expense if any claims are asserted by a third party against the
  Licensor by reason of Licensee&#39;s misconduct or breach of any terms of the
  License, including failed adherence by the Licensee with any applicable laws,
  including, whether express or implied.

* **9.2**  **Severability.** The unenforceability of any single provision of
  this License shall not affect any other provision hereof. Where such a
  provision is held to be unenforceable, the Parties shall use their best
  endeavours to negotiate and agree upon an enforceable provision, which
  achieves, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, legal and commercial
  objectives of the unenforceable provision.

* **9.3**  **Waiver.** A failure of either Party to enforce strictly a provision
  of this License shall in no event be considered a waiver of any part of such
  provision. No waiver by either Party of any breach or default by the other
  party shall operate as a waiver of any succeeding breach or other default or
  breach by such other Party. No waiver shall have any effect unless it is
  specific, irrevocable and in writing.

* **9.4**  **Term and termination.** The License shall commence upon Licensee&#39;s
  access to the Software and continue until terminated by the Licensor. Upon
  termination of the License, the Licensee agrees to (i) stop all access and use
  of the Software and (ii) destroy all copies of the Software and all its
  component parts (if any) stored on the Devices. The provisions of the License
  that, by their nature, continue and survive will survive any termination of
  the License.

* **9.5**  **Amendments.** The Licensor reserves the right, at its sole
  discretion, to change or modify this License at any time by sending a prior
  notification to the Licensee (if the contact details of the Licensee are
  available to the Licensor).  Any modifications to the License shall become
  effective on the date indicated at the top of the amended License.  By
  continuing to use the Software after the date on which the modifications were
  communicated, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the modified License.  The
  Licensor reserves the right to change or discontinue the Software and any
  feature thereof with or without a prior notice to the Licensee.

* **9.6**  **Entire agreement.**  This License constitutes the entire
  understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof
  and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations and discussions between the
  Parties relating thereto.

* **9.7**  **Transfer of rights.** The Licensee is not allowed to assign
  Licensee&#39;s rights under the License. The Licensor is entitled to transfer its
  rights and obligations under the License entirely or partially to a third
  party by giving a prior notice to the Licensee. If the Licensee does not agree
  to the transfer, the Licensee can terminate this License by ceasing to use the
  Software.

* **9.8**  **Contact.** For general enquiries and commercial licenses to use the
  Software, please contact the Licensor directly.
