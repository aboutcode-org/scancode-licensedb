  \n\nAdditional Permissions:\n\n\n1. Linking Exception.\n\nAs a special exception to GPLv3+,\
  \ Red Hat grants you permission to link\nsoftware whose sources are distributed under a license\
  \ that satisfies\nthe Open Source Definition with libcygwin.a, without libcygwin.a\nitself\
  \ causing the resulting program to be covered by GPLv3+.\n\nThis means that you can port an\
  \ Open Source application to Cygwin, and\ndistribute that executable as if it didn't include\
  \ a copy of\nlibcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the\nCygwin DLL\
  \ itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of\nthe Cygwin DLL, you must adhere\
  \ to the terms of GPLv3+, including the\nrequirement to provide sources for the Cygwin DLL,\
  \ unless you have obtained\na special Cygwin license to distribute the Cygwin DLL in only\
  \ its binary\nform (see below).\n\nSee http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/ for the precise\
  \ Open Source\nDefinition referenced above.\n\n\n2.  Files Excluded from GPL Coverage.\n\n\
  Red Hat grants you permission to distribute Cygwin with the following\nfiles, which are not\
  \ considered part of Cygwin and are not governed by\nGPLv3+, in source or binary form.\n\n\
  winsup\\testsuite\\winsup.api\\msgtest.c\nwinsup\\testsuite\\winsup.api\\semtest.c\nwinsup\\\
  testsuite\\winsup.api\\shmtest.c\n\nRed Hat grants you permission to link or combine code\
  \ in Cygwin with\ncode in or corresponding to the following files, which are not\nconsidered\
  \ part of Cygwin and are not governed by GPLv3+, and to\ndistribute such combinations under\
  \ terms of your choice, provided that\nsuch terms are otherwise consistent with the application\
  \ of GPLv3+ to\nCygwin itself.  You must comply with GPLv3+ with respect to all\nportions\
  \ of such combinations other than those that correspond to or\nare derived from such non-Cygwin\
  \ code but which do not correspond to\nor are not derived from Cygwin itself.\n\nwinsup\\\
  cygserver\\sysv_shm.cc\n\n\n3.  Alternative License. \n\nRed Hat sells a special Cygwin License\
  \ for customers who are unable to\nprovide their application in open source code form.  For\
