  "text": "# The Katharos License v0.2.0\n\n## Preamble\n\n**THIS PREAMBLE SECTION DOES NOT DEFINE ANY TERMS OF USE OR IMPOSE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE LICENSED WORK. IT IS PURELY INFORMATIONAL. ALL LICENSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN DETAIL BELOW IN \"TERMS AND CONDITIONS\".**\n\nKatharos is the Greek word for \"pure\" and, correspondingly, the purpose of the Katharos license is to prevent the licensed work from being used to promote destructive activities or to produce other impure or destructive works.\n\nThe Katharos License is not an \"Open Source\" license in the official sense: it has not been reviewed or approved by the [Open Source Initiative][osi] and may or may not comply with the [Open Source Definition][osd]. Even still, we want the Katharos License to promote the openness, sharing, and collaboration that is common in the Open Source community, while at the same time protecting the people who may otherwise become victims of the destructive application of our shared works. We want the works that we share to be uplifting and helpful and we want them to be used to benefit people.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, this license seeks to put limits on what people are allowed to do with the licensed work. This includes, among other things, disallowing the work to be incorporated in or used to produce sexually suggestive or explicit content which we believe is mentally, psychologically, and spiritually harmful.\n\nThe definition of what is \"good\", though, can be considered highly subjective. Our idea of what is good and pure comes from our interpretation of The Word of God, The Holy Bible, and we believe that God is the ultimate authority for what is good and right.\n\nThe terms of this license reflect what we believe God has put on our hearts to include in this license, and we acknowledge that our attempt to define its terms will be imperfect, and that human laws cannot flawlessly reflect the will of God. Nonetheless, the fact remains that we believe God led us to create this license and that it is our due diligence to protect what we believe is important.\n\nMany people will not agree with the terms, but it is not our goal to make a license that many will agree with. Our goal is to stand up for what we believe in and do what we believe is right, while being as free and open as otherwise possible.\n\n[osi]: https://opensource.org/\n[osd]: https://opensource.org/docs/osd\n\n## Terms and Conditions\n\nCopyright \u00a9 [year] [copyright holder].

Failure to Comply\n\nAny failure of Licensee to act according to the terms and conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and an infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor (subject to exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a breach or infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which Licensee is subject. Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against Licensee through specific performance (or similar remedy under Laws) to the extent permitted by Laws. For clarity, except in the event of a breach of this License, infringement, or as otherwise stated in this License, Licensor may not terminate this License with Licensee.\n\n### 9. Enforceability and Interpretation\n\nIf any term or provision of this License is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this License or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction; provided, however, subject to a court modification pursuant to the immediately following sentence, if any term or provision of this License pertaining to Permitted Use of Work is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights in the Work granted to Licensee shall be deemed null and void as between Licensor and Licensee. Upon a determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws, the court may modify this License to affect the original purpose that the Work be used in compliance with Permitted Use of Work as closely as possible. The language in this License shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.\n\n### 10. Revised Versions of this License\n\nKatharos Technology may publish revised and/or new versions of the Katharos License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Work specifies that a certain numbered version of the Katharos License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by Katharos Technology. If the Work does not specify a version number of the Katharos License, you may choose any version ever published by Katharos Technology.\n\nIf the Work specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the Katharos License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Work.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n### 11. Limitation of Liability\n\nTO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THIS SOFTWARE COMES \u201cAS IS,\u201d WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR AND ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n## Use of the Katharos License\n\n### Creating Derivative Licenses\n\nYou may freely modify and distribute your own derivatives of the Katharos License itself and apply it to your works provided that you do not call the derivative license the \"Katharos License\" and you clearly indicate that the derivative license is a modification of the Katharos License. Only wholly unmodified versions of the Katharos License may be called the \"Katharos License\".\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nTHIS KATHAROS LICENSE IS OFFERED FOR USE BY LICENSORS AT THEIR OWN RISK, ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS, AND WITH NO WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAWS.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis license has incorporated verbatim and modified portions of the following licenses:\n\n- [Hippocratic License Version 2.1](https://firstdonoharm.dev/version/2/1/license.html)\n- [Do No Harm License](https://github.com/raisely/NoHarm)\n- [BSD 3-Clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html)\n- [GNU General Public License Version 3 ( GPLv3 )](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)"
