text: "Linux Documentation Project Copying License\nLast modified 30 March 1994\n\nThe following\
  \ copyright license applies to all works by the Linux Documentation Project.\n\nPlease read\
  \ the license carefully---it is somewhat like the GNU General Public License, but there are\
  \ several conditions in it that differ from what you may be used to. If you have any questions,\
  \ please mail Matt Welsh, the LDP coordinator, at mdw@sunsite.unc.edu.\n\nThe Linux Documentation\
  \ Project manuals may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part, subject to the following\
  \ conditions:\n\nAll Linux Documentation Project manuals are copyrighted by their respective\
  \ authors. THEY ARE NOT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n\n    The copyright notice above and this permission\
  \ notice must be preserved complete on all complete or partial copies.\n    Any translation\
  \ or derivative work of Linux Installation and Getting Started must be approved by the author\
  \ in writing before distribution.\n    If you distribute Linux Installation and Getting Started\
  \ in part, instructions for obtaining the complete version of this manual must be included,\
  \ and a means for obtaining a complete version provided.\n    Small portions may be reproduced\
  \ as illustrations for reviews or quotes in other works without this permission notice if\
  \ proper citation is given.\n    The GNU General Public License referenced below may be reproduced\
  \ under the conditions given within it. \n\nExceptions to these rules may be granted for academic\
  \ purposes: Write to the author and ask. These restrictions are here to protect us as authors,\
  \ not to restrict you as educators and learners. All source code in Linux Installation and\
  \ Getting Started is placed under the GNU General Public License, available via anonymous\
  \ FTP from here.\n\nPublishing LDP Manuals\nIf you're a publishing company interested in distributing\
  \ any of the LDP manuals, read on.\n\nBy the license given in the previous section, anyone\
  \ is allowed to publish and distribute verbatim copies of the Linux Documentation Project\
  \ manuals. You don't need our explicit permission for this. However, if you would like to\
  \ distribute a translation or derivative work based on any of the LDP manuals, you must obtain\
  \ permission from the author, in writing, before doing so.\n\nAll translations and derivative\
  \ works of LDP manuals must be placed under the Linux Documentation License given in the previous\
  \ section. That is, if you plan to release a translation of one of the manuals, it must be\
  \ freely distributable by the above terms.\n\nYou may, of course, sell the LDP manuals for\
  \ profit. We encourage you to do so. Keep in mind, however, that because the LDP manuals are\
  \ freely distributable, anyone may photocopy or distribute printed copies free of charge,\
  \ if they wish to do so.\n\nWe do not require to be paid royalties for any profit earned from\
  \ selling LDP manuals. However, we would like to suggest that if you do sell LDP manuals for\
  \ profit, that you either offer the author royalties, or donate a portion of your earnings\
  \ to the author, the LDP as a whole, or to the Linux development community. You may also wish\
  \ to send one or more free copies of the LDP manual that you are distributing to the author.\
  \ Your show of support for the LDP and the Linux community will be very appreciated.\n\nWe\
  \ would like to be informed of any plans to publish or distribute LDP manuals, just so we\
  \ know how they're becoming available. If you are publishing or planning to publish any LDP\
  \ manuals, please send mail to Matt Welsh (mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) either by electronic mail\
  \ or telephone at +1 607 256 7372.\n\nWe encourage Linux software distributors to distribute\
  \ the LDP manuals (such as the Installation and Getting Started Guide) with their software.\
  \ The LDP manuals are intended to be used as the \"official\" Linux documentation, and we'd\
  \ like to see mail-order distributors bundling the LDP manuals with the software. As the LDP\
  \ manuals mature, hopefully they will fulfill this goal more adequately.\n\nMatt Welsh, mdw@sunsite.unc.edu\n"
