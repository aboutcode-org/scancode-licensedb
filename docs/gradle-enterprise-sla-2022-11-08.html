Effective starting: November 8, 2022

This Gradle Enterprise Software License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into as of the date these terms are accepted by Customer (as defined below) (“Effective Date”), by and between Gradle, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 2261 Market Street #4081, San Francisco, CA 94114 (“Gradle” or “Company”) and the end user of the Software (as defined below), on behalf of itself or its Affiliates (“Customer”) (each of Gradle and Customer a “Party” and together, the “Parties”). References to “us” and “we” in this Agreement shall refer to Gradle. References to “you” or and “yours” in this Agreement shall refer to the Customer.

1. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

“Affiliate” of a Party means any person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, now or hereinafter, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with that Party, where “control” is defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct the policies, management or affairs of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise, and “ownership” means the beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.

“Agreement Effective Date” is the earlier of the Effective Date or the date that Customer, or its representative or any reseller on behalf of Customer, first places an order for the Software through an Order Form.

“Defect” means any failure of the Software to meet the specifications contained in the Documentation for the Software.

“Documentation” means all documents and materials provided by Gradle to the Customer that aid the Customer in the use and operation of Software, including (i) functional, technical, design and performance specifications and characteristics, (ii) product documentation, drawings, reports, notes, memoranda and commentary, (iii) installation, configuration, administration, operation and maintenance procedures and instructions, and (iv) training materials, end user manuals and guides. Documentation is considered part of the Software.

“Fees” means the fees Customer is required to pay Gradle to use the Software during the applicable Order Form Term (as defined below). The Fees are reflected on each applicable Order Form.

The “Order Form” is a written or electronic form provided by Gradle to Customer or Customer’s Affiliate that describes the Software that Gradle is to provide to Customer or Customer’s Affiliate hereunder as well as the Fees and that specifically references this Agreement. Once delivered by Gradle, each Order Form shall be incorporated into and becomes a part of this Agreement.

“Seats” means the number of Users authorized to use the Software, as set forth in the applicable Order Form. 

“Software” means the Gradle Enterprise downloadable software product, including the Documentation and any generally available Updates.

An “Update” is a Software release that the Company makes generally available to its customers, along with any corresponding changes to Documentation. An Update includes bug fixes, error corrections, patches, major or minor releases, or any other changes or enhancements. An Update is generally indicated by a change in the digit to the right of the second decimal point (e.g., a change from version x.x.x to x.x.y). An Update including an enhancement, new feature, or new functionality, is generally indicated by a change in the digit to the right of the first decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to x.y.x) or to the left of the first decimal point (e.g., x.x.x to y.x.x).

“User” means a person who accesses, uses, interacts with or directs the Software in the performance of its functions and/or contributing code to a source repository that has a build that is connected with Gradle Enterprise to collect build data, use the Gradle Enterprise build cache or use the Gradle Enterprise testing agent. For the avoidance of doubt, any person who accesses, uses or interacts with the Software for oversight or governance purposes (i.e. internal audit, external audit, or internal security risk personnel) shall not be deemed to be a “User” under this Agreement for purposes of Seat count. 

“Virus” means any virus, malware, spyware, malicious code, trojan horse, worm, back door or other program, routine, instruction, device or code that would, or is designed or intended to, delete, disrupt, disable, deactivate, interfere with, dispute, erase, deny access to, enable any person to access without authorization, produce modifications of, or otherwise interfere with the use of the Software and excludes License Key Mechanisms.  “License Key Mechanism” means a mechanism solely intended to disable the Software after the termination or expiration of the applicable Order Form, or in the event Software is used in a manner that exceeds the Scope of Use. If Software is disabled by any such License Key Mechanism during the applicable Order Form Term in the absence of any unauthorized use of the Software, Gradle shall promptly provide Software “keys” to enable the Software at Customer’s request.

Other capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth herein.

2. Account registration. Customer may need to register for an Gradle account in order to place orders or access or receive the Software. Any registration information that Customer provides to Gradle must be accurate, current and complete. Customer must update and keep current the registration information provided to Gradle so that Gradle may send notices, statements and other information to Customer via email or through Customer’s account. Customer is responsible for all actions taken through its Gradle account.

3. Order.

3.1 Directly with Gradle. Each Order Form shall specify the authorized scope of use for the Software, which may include, as applicable, (i) usage metrics and (ii) the number and type of authorized Seats (as defined below) (collectively, “Scope of Use”). The term “Order Form” also includes any amendment or expansion order forms requested by and delivered to Customer or Customer’s Affiliate for Software or Support and Maintenance services or to amend, increase or upgrade the Scope of Use.

3.2 Reseller Orders.  If Customer purchases the Software through an authorized reseller (each a “Reseller”),  the Scope of Use shall be as stated in the Order Form placed by Reseller for Customer, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order Form. Resellers are not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Gradle’s behalf, and Gradle is not bound by any obligations to any end user or Customer, other than as set forth in this Agreement. The terms of any transaction between a Customer or end user and a Reseller shall be governed by and subject to the agreement entered into by and between such Customer or end user and Reseller with respect to such transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, use of the Software by any end user, regardless of whether the Software was purchased from a Reseller, shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, and any end user of the Software shall be subject to and bound by the terms of this Agreement in the same manner as a Customer.  

3.3 Seats. Only one User may use a Seat at any given time. Customer may remove or suspend Users at its own discretion. In the event of removal or suspension of a User by Customer, Customer may assign a new User to the unoccupied Seat only after such Seat has remained inactive for a period of thirty (30) days (a “Reassigned Seat”). A Reassigned Seat shall continue under the Order Form Term of the original User. Customer may increase the number of authorized Seats permitted to access the Software by requesting expansion Order Form. Customer shall be charged the same amount on a per-Seat basis for the applicable Order Form Term, prorated for the remainder of the applicable Order Form Term. Upon any renewal of the applicable Order Form Term, Gradle shall invoice Customer for all Seats at once (including the Seats added pursuant to an expansion Order Form), at the then-current price. Customer agrees that any orders made for additional Seats during the Order Form Term shall be governed by this Agreement.

3.4 Users. Users may be Customer or its Affiliates’ employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, or other third parties who are acting solely for the benefit of the Customer or its Affiliate or solely on the Customer’s or its Affiliate’s behalf. Customer is responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Users. All use of Software by Users must be within the Scope of Use and solely for the benefit of the Customer and its Affiliates.

4. Software Terms.  

4.1 License Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Gradle grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to install and use the Software during the applicable Order Form Term in accordance with this Agreement, the Scope of Use, the Documentation and the Order Form. The Software requires a license key in order to operate, which shall be delivered as described in Section 5 (Delivery).

4.2 Third Party Code. The Software includes code and libraries licensed to Gradle by third parties, including software whose licenses require Gradle to make the source code for those components available. The source code for such components shall be provided upon request. Before a new component is added to the Software, Gradle shall complete an internal process to ensure such component may be safely distributed. Gradle warrants that the Software does not and will not include any software distributed under a license that would: (a) grant to any third party any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, (b) subject Customer to any obligation to disclose, distribute or license its own product(s) in source code form or otherwise make the product(s) available for use by third parties or for the purpose of creating derivative works, or (c) add or place any more onerous restrictions on Customer’s use of the Software than is included in this Agreement.

4.3 Security. All Software provided by Gradle, including third party embedded software, shall have the latest security patches installed as follows: (i) for Software provided by Gradle, all security patches shall be made available to Customer promptly upon release; and (ii) for third party embedded software, critical security patches (CVSS between 9.1 and 10) shall be made available to Customer within seven (7) days of release. 

5. Delivery. Gradle shall deliver the applicable license keys to the email addresses specified in the applicable Order Form upon receipt of payment of the applicable Fees. All deliveries under this Agreement shall be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer is responsible for installation of any Software, and Customer acknowledges that Gradle has no further delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the license keys. If Customer loses access to or damages Customer’s instance of the Software, Gradle shall provide access to another copy of the Software at no charge.

6. Verifications. At Gradle’s request, Customer shall provide a signed certification that it is using the Software pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including with respect to Scope of Use. Upon request by Gradle, Customer agrees to audit its use of the Software and run all reports necessary to ensure the Software is being used as authorized by this Agreement. If the audit identifies unauthorized use of the license, including with respect to Scope of Use, Gradle may invoice Customer for any past or ongoing excessive use, and Customer shall be required to pay such invoice promptly (but in any event no later than ten (10) days) following delivery of the invoice. This remedy is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Gradle at law or equity or under this Agreement. To the extent obligated to do so, Gradle may share audit results with certain of its third party licensors.

7. Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, Customer shall not, and shall not permit any other person to: (a) transfer, rent, sell, assign, distribute, lease, provide access to or otherwise make available the Software to any other person, (b) copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of the Software, (c) use the Software for the benefit of any third party, (d) incorporate the Software into a product or service that Customer provides to a third party, (e) interfere with any License Key Mechanism in the Software or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Software intended to limit Customer’s use, (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to the Software, except to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law, (g) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Software, or (h) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Software.

8. Financial Terms. 

8.1 Payments.  Customer agrees to pay all Fees in accordance with each Order Form. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form, Customer shall pay all amounts in U.S. dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice. All amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable, and Customer shall have no right of offset or withholding under this Agreement. In making payments, Customer acknowledges that Customer is not relying on (i) future availability of the Software beyond the current Order Form Term or (ii) any Upgrades or Software feature enhancements. If Customer purchases the Software through a Reseller, Customer shall make any required payments to the Reseller pursuant to the terms of any agreement by and between the Customer and the Reseller. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Gradle may terminate Customer’s right to use the Software if Gradle does not receive its corresponding payment from the Reseller, or if Customer is in breach of this Agreement.

8.2 Price Increase. During the Applicable Order Form Initial Term, Customer may order additional quantities of the Software at a price not to exceed the price set forth in the applicable Order Form. Pricing and Fees for the Software may not be increased during the Order Form Initial Term. Following the Initial Period, Gradle may change, increase or restructure Fees on an annual basis by providing Customer at least thirty (30) days notice prior to the commencement of any Order Form Renewal Term. 

8.3 Taxes. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Software (excluding taxes based on Gradle’s net income). To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Gradle, Customer must pay to Gradle the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any Fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties, Customer must provide Gradle with any such exemption information along with an appropriate certificate of exemption within thirty (30) days of the date of any invoice or statement from Gradle or any taxing authorities.

9. Limited Warranties.

9.1 Limited Warranties. Gradle warrants to Customer that (i) Gradle shall take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Software, in the form and at the time first made available to Customer for download, will be free of any Viruses; and (ii) for ninety (90) days from the date the Software is first made available to Customer for download (the “Warranty Period”) the unmodified Software, when used as authorized by this Agreement, shall materially conform to the technical and performance functions of the Software describe in the Documentation.  If during the Warranty Period Customer demonstrates to Gradle that there is a Defect in the Software, then Gradle shall  respond to Customer with either (a) a statement that Gradle has in good faith and using commercially reasonable efforts not yet been able to duplicate the alleged Defect, or (b) a plan indicating whether Gradle intends, at its option or expense, to (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Defect and repair the Software; (ii) provide Customer with replacement Software of equivalent or greater functionality or (iii) terminate this Agreement with respect to the defective Software, and refund the Fees pre-paid by Customer for the defective Software during the then-current Term (once Customer’s access to the Software has been removed). The remedies set forth in this Section 9.1 are Customer’s sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of warranty by Gradle.

The limited warranties provided in this Section 9.1 shall not apply to any Defects arising from: 

    improper installation of the Software by Customer, or any other party other than Gradle, or the installation of the Software on improper hardware;

    neglect of the Customer;
    misuse of the Software by Customer;
    use of the Software with data of person other than Customer; or
    use of the Software in any manner that is not expressly permitted by this Agreement or the Documentation.

9.2 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 9.1 (LIMITED WARRANTIES), ALL SOFTWARE, SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AND ANY ADDITIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. THE LIMITED WARRANTIES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 9.1 ABOVE ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND ANY MAINTENANCE, TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR ADDITIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY GRADLE.

Gradle may terminate this Agreement without the requirement of notice if, at the end of the Order Form Initial Term or each Order Form Renewal Term, as applicable, Customer fails to pay any Fees, charges or taxes required to renew the Seats for an additional Order Form Term when due.

12.3 Termination for Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement before the expiration of all Order Form Terms if the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement, including by failure to make payments when due, and fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days following delivery of written notice of the breach.
