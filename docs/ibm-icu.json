Time Zone Database\nICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\n7.  Database Ownership\n\n   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public\n   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply\n   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\n   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\n   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in\n   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\n   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court\n   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust\n   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the\n   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that\n   contribution or in the TZ Database."
