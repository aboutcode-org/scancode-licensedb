At\n    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n    Compiled form of the Package.\n\n    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\n    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n    will be subject to the Original License.\n\n\n    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n    you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n        Version.\n\n        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.

Such instructions must be\n    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\n    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\n    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\n    the Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\n    Aggregating or Linking the Package\n\n    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n    as included in the aggregation.\n\n    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\n    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\n    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n    terms of this license.\n\n\n    General Provisions\n\n    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n    license.\n\n    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\n    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\n    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n    this license.\n\n    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n    date that such litigation is filed.\n\n    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\n    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\n    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\n    NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\n    LAW.

For the purposes\n          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n          \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n          the copyright owner.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
