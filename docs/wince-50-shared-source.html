   7. Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted.

You may not:

   1. Use the Software or information derived from the Software for any project related to, or to make any Enhancements or derivative works of the Software for use with, a non-Microsoft operating system or related to a device or piece of hardware based on a non-Microsoft operating system.

Also, you must pass this limitation of liability on whenever you distribute the Software.
   9. That if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to this Software for a person&#39;s use of this Software, your license to this Software ends automatically.
  10. Not to assert patents owned or licensable by You that claim (i) any inventions in any Enhancements or derivative works You develop using the Software or (ii) any inventions You derive from the Software (collectively, Your Patents) against Microsoft, Microsoft affiliates, and Microsoft Licensees (as defined below), excluding OEM/ODM Licensees (as defined below), for infringement of Your Patents on account of the making, use, sale, offer for sale, importation or other disposition or promotion of any version or portion of Windows CE. If You or Your affiliates choose to assert Your Patents against OEM/ODM Licensees on account of the OEM/ODM Licensees making, use, sale, offer for sale, importation or other disposition or promotion of Windows CE, portion thereof, or a redistributed portion thereof, then You and Your affiliates agree to offer licenses to such OEM/ODM Licensees under commercially reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and pricing.
  11. If You assign any of Your Patents or rights to enforce any of Your Patents, You will require that the assignee(s) agree to be bound by this Section. Any such assignment by You not in accordance with this Section will be null and void.
