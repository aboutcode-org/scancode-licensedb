i.    Distributable Code.  You may modify, copy, use and distribute the Distributable Code so long as you comply with the Program Agreement as well as all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement.  You may, however, sublicense to OEMs who have entered into a Program Agreement, the right to modify, copy and distribute the Distributable Code, as set forth in Section 2(a)(ii).  &#34;Distributable Code&#34; means the source and object code form of the Sample Code in conjunction with and as part of an implementation of the Licensed LLTD Specification as incorporated into a Consumer Product (as such terms are defined in the Program Agreement).  
ii.   Third Party Distribution.  The license above only provides: (a) the right to grant to OEMs who purchase your products a sublicense to modify the Distributable Code only as necessary to customize OEM products that incorporate your Consumer Products and only so long as the OEM and the modified Distributable Code complies with all terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Program Agreement; (b) the right to grant to any of your OEMs, distributors and dealers a license to make, sell, offer for sale and distribute an object code copy of the Distributable Code (or OEM modified Distributable Code) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Program Agreement; and (c) the right to grant to any end user a license to use an object code copy of the Distributable Code (or OEM modified Distributable Code) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Program Agreement.

•	that others have the right to modify it; or
•	that the code be disclosed or distributed free of charge.
b.	Sample Code Modifications.

3.	SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The Sample Code is licensed, not sold. This Agreement only gives you some rights to use the Sample Code.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the Sample Code only as expressly permitted in this Agreement.  In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the Sample Code that only allow you to use it in certain ways.    You may not
•	publish the Sample Code for others to copy;
•	rent, lease or lend the Sample Code; or
•	transfer the Sample Code or this Agreement to any third party.

You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the Sample Code.  This Agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
10.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.   THE SAMPLE CODE IS LICENSED &#34;AS-IS.&#34;  YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT.  MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.  YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.  YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to
•	anything related to the Sample Code, documentation, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
•	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
