text: "W3C Software Notice and License\n\nStatus: This license was applied to software published\
  \ by W3C before 13 May,\n2015. On 13 May, 2015, W3C adopted a revised and renamed \"software\
  \ and document\"\nlicense and applied the new license to all W3C documents that had previously\n\
  been made available under this license. The new license grants all permissions\nthat had been\
  \ granted under this 2002 license.\n\nThis work (and included software, documentation such\
  \ as READMEs, or other\nrelated items) is being provided by the copyright holders under the\
  \ following\nlicense. \n\nLicense\n\nBy obtaining, using and/or copying this work, you (the\
  \ licensee) agree that you\nhave read, understood, and will comply with the following terms\
  \ and conditions.\n\nPermission to copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation,\n\
  with or without modification, for any purpose and without fee or royalty is\nhereby granted,\
  \ provided that you include the following on ALL copies of the\nsoftware and documentation\

  \ viewable to users of the\n    redistributed or derivative work.\n\n    Any pre-existing\
  \ intellectual property disclaimers, notices, or terms and\n    conditions. If none exist,\
  \ the W3C Software Short Notice should be included\n    (hypertext is preferred, text is permitted)\
  \ within the body of any\n    redistributed or derivative code.\n\n    Notice of any changes\
  \ or modifications to the files, including the date\n    changes were made. (We recommend\
  \ you provide URIs to the location from which\n    the code is derived.)\n\nDisclaimers\n\n\

  \ http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231\n\nThis formulation\
  \ of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.\nThis version removes the\
  \ copyright ownership notice such that this license can\nbe used with materials other than\
  \ those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is\nnow a host of the W3C, includes references\
  \ to this specific dated version of the\nlicense, and removes the ambiguous grant of \"use\"\
  . Otherwise, this version is\nthe same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve\
  \ the Free\nSoftware Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification\n\
  under the Open Source Definition."
