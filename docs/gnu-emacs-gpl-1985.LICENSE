GNU EMACS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license, but changing it is not allowed.

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share GNU Emacs.  To make
sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of Emacs, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change Emacs or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of Emacs, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for GNU Emacs.  If Emacs is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.

  Therefore we (Richard Stallman and the Free Software Fundation,
Inc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be
allowed to distribute or change GNU Emacs.

			COPYING POLICIES

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of GNU Emacs source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each file a valid copyright notice such
as "Copyright (C) 1985 Richard M. Stallman", containing the year of
last change and name of copyright holder for the file in question;
keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this License
Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the GNU Emacs program a copy of this License Agreement
along with the program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of GNU Emacs source code or
any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under
the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    who last changed such files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of GNU Emacs
    or any part thereof, to be freely distributed
    and licensed to all third parties on terms identical to those
    contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose
    to grant more extensive warranty protection to third parties,
    at your option).

    c) if the modified program serves as a text editor, cause it
    when started running in the simplest and usual way, to print
    an announcement including a valid copyright notice ("Copyright
    (C)", the year of authorship, and all copyright owners' names),
    saying that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
    this License Agreement.

  3. You may copy and distribute GNU Emacs or any portion of it in
compiled, executable or object code form under the terms of Paragraphs
1 and 2 above provided that you do the following:

    a) cause each such copy of GNU Emacs to be accompanied by the
    corresponding machine-readable source code; or

    b) cause each such copy of GNU Emacs to be accompanied by a
    written offer, with no time limit, to give any third party
    free (except for a nominal shipping charge) machine readable
    copy of the corresponding source code; or

    c) in the case of a recipient of GNU Emacs in compiled, executable
    or object code form (without the corresponding source code) you
    shall cause copies you distribute to be accompanied by a copy
    of the written offer of source code which you received along
    with the copy of GNU Emacs.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs is void and
your rights to use GNU Emacs under this License agreement shall be
automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer
software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
software are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
