Licensors may therefore wish\nto use this license together with another license for the contents.\n\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\nactivities not covered by this License.\n\nThe Licensor (as defined below)\n\nand\n\nYou (as defined below)\n\nagree as follows:\n\n1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\n\"Collective Database\" \u2013 Means this Database in unmodified form as part\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\nassembled into a collective whole.

Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\nThe copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\nDatabase, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\nindependent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details.

Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\nroyalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\na member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\nschemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\ngranted under this License.\n\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\n\n4.0 Conditions of Use\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\nYour complying with the following conditions of use.

Creating and Using a Produced\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\nis available under this License.\n\na.

If\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\nrequired URI\u2019s with the above notice.\n\n4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database.

For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\nall moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\nextent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n10.4;\n\nb. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\njurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\nrights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\nfullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\nSection 10.4; and\n\nc. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\nmoral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\nmoral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\n\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\njurisdictions.\n\n6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\nDatabase, including without limitation:\n\na.
