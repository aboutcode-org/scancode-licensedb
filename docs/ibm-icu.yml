  \n\n5. Time Zone Database\nICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\
  \ Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP\
  \ 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\n7.  Database Ownership\n\
  \n   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n   document.  Rather it\
  \ is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n   that is in the public domain, and is intended\
  \ to remain in the public\n   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not\
  \ apply\n   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\n   Should any\
  \ claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\n   the organization that is providing\
  \ the IANA Considerations defined in\n   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with\
  \ the IETF,\n   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court\n   orders.\
  \  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust\n   on the database or the\
  \ code.  Any person making a contribution to the\n   database or code waives all rights to\
  \ future claims in that\n   contribution or in the TZ Database."
