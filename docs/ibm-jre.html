Part 1 - General Terms 

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND 

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT. 

&#34;IBM&#34; is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries. 

&#34;License Information&#34; (&#34;LI&#34;) is a document that provides information specific to a Program. The Program&#39;s LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ . The LI may also be found in a file in the Program&#39;s directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program. 

&#34;Program&#34; is the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation. 

A &#34;Proof of Entitlement&#34; (&#34;PoE&#34;) is evidence of Your authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

&#34;You&#34; and &#34;Your&#34; refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity. 

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the terms of the latter agreement prevail. 

1. Entitlement 

License 

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. 

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully acquire it. 

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program. 

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another party. 

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of this Agreement. 

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program. 

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its PoE. 

Money-back Guarantee 

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund. 

Program Transfer 

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, including the Program&#39;s PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program. 

2. Charges 

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement. 

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on IBM&#39;s net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it. 

3. No Warranty 

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY. 

The exclusion also applies to any of IBM&#39;s Program developers and suppliers. 

Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs may provide their own warranties. 

IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM specifies otherwise. 

4. Limitation of Liability 

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM&#39;s part or other liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the Program that is the subject of the claim. 

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM&#39;s Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively responsible. 

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA; 

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR 

3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS. 

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

5. General 

1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. 

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations. 

4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact information, including names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such information will be processed and used in connection with our business relationship, and may be provided to contractors, Business Partners, and assignees of IBM for uses consistent with their collective business activities, including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, for promotions, and for market research). 

5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose unless otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation. 

6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control. 

7. This Agreement will not create any right or cause of action for any third party, nor will IBM be responsible for any third party claims against You except, as permitted by the Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable. 

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration 

Governing Law 

Both You and IBM consent to the application of the laws of the country in which You acquired the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Your and IBM&#39;s rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles. 

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. 

Jurisdiction 

All of our rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the country in which You acquired the Program license.
