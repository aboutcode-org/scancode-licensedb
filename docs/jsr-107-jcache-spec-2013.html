(ii) is clearly and prominently marked with the word &#34;UNTESTED&#34; or &#34;EARLY ACCESS&#34; or &#34;INCOMPATIBLE&#34; or &#34;UNSTABLE&#34; or &#34;BETA&#34; in any list of available builds and in proximity to every link initiating its download, where the list or link is under Licensee&#39;s control; and
(iii) includes the following notice:
&#34;This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java Community Process (JCP) and is made available for testing and evaluation purposes only. The code is not compatible with any specification of the JCP.&#34; The grant set forth above concerning your distribution of implementations of the specification is contingent upon your agreement to terminate development and distribution of your &#34;early draft&#34; implementation as soon as feasible following final completion of the specification.

In addition, this license will terminate immediately without notice from Oracle or Greg Luck if you fail to comply with any provision of this license. Upon termination, you must cease use of or destroy the Specification. &#34;Licensor Name Space&#34; means the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with &#34;java&#34;, &#34;javax&#34;, &#34;com.oracle&#34; or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Oracle or Greg Luck through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or replacements thereof
