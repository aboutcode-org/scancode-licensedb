14.2 Quarterly User Count. In accordance with the pricing structure stipulated within the relevant Order Form and this Agreement, in instances where the pricing assessment is contingent upon the number of users, Anaconda will conduct a periodic true-up on  a quarterly basis to ascertain the alignment between the actual number of users utilizing the services and the initially reported user count, and to assess for any unauthorized or noncompliant usage.

14.3 Penalties for Overage or Noncompliant Use.  Should the actual User count exceed the figure initially provided, or unauthorized usage is uncovered, the contracting party shall remunerate the difference to Anaconda, encompassing the additional Users or noncompliant use in compliance with Anaconda’s then-current pricing terms. The payment for such difference shall be due in accordance with the invoicing and payment provisions specified in these TOS and/or within the relevant Order and the Agreement.
