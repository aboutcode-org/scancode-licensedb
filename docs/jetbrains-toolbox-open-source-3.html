If a revision meaningfully reduces Your rights, We will use reasonable efforts to notify You (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical contact You provide to us, posting on our blog, through Your JetBrains Account, or via the Product itself). If We modify Agreement, the modified version of Agreement will be effective upon the next Toolbox Subscription term. In this case, if You object to the updated Agreement terms, as Your exclusive remedy, You may cancel Toolbox Subscription. You may be required to click through the updated Agreement to show Your acceptance. For the avoidance of doubt, any Subscription Confirmation is subject to the version of the Agreement in effect on the Subscription Confirmation date.
