text: "Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License\n\nVersion 1.1\n\nPLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT\
  \ CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE\nACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF\
  \ THIS COMPUTER\nASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\"LICENSE\"). ANY USE,\nREPRODUCTION,\
  \ MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES\nTHE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS\
  \ LICENSE.\n\nLicense Background\n\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes\
  \ in open source. We\nbelieve that the open source development approach can take appropriate\n\
  software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and\ninnovation. To demonstrate\
  \ our continuing commitment to open source, we\nare releasing the Program (as defined below)\
  \ under this License.\n\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of\
  \ the\nProgram to use the Program, including its source code, freely and\nwithout many of\
  \ the concerns of some other open source licenses.\nAlthough we expect the underlying Program,\
  \ and Contributions (as defined\nbelow) made to such Program, to remain open, this License\
  \ is designed to\npermit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License\n\
  unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program\nmust be distributed\
  \ under the terms of this License.\n\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions\
  \ under\nwhich you may use the Program.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in\
  \ the case of CA, the Original Program; and\n(b) in the case of each Contributor (including\
  \ CA), changes and\nadditions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the\n\
  Program originate from and are distributed by that particular\nContributor to unaffiliated\
  \ third parties. A Contribution originates\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program\
  \ by such Contributor\nitself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions\
  \ do\nnot include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of\nsoftware distributed\
  \ in conjunction with the Program under their own\nlicense agreement, and (y) are not derivative\
  \ works of the Program.\n\n1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes\n\
  the Program.\n\n1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the\nProgram\
  \ that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any\nContributions made to the Program\
  \ thereafter.\n\n1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions\nthereof\
  \ with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents\
  \ licensable by a Contributor that are\ninfringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\
  \ or when combined\nwith the Program.\n\n1.6 Original Program means the original version of\
  \ the software to which\nthis License is attached and as released by CA, including source\
  \ code,\nobject code and documentation, if any.\n\n1.7 Program means the Original Program\
  \ and Contributions.\n\n1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes\
  \ the\nProgram.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor\
  \ hereby grants\nRecipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license\n\
  to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\nperform, distribute\
  \ and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\nif any, and such derivative works,\
  \ in source code and object code form.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in\
  \ this Section 2.1\nshall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\n\
  \n2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient an irrevocable,\
  \ non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license\nto the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary\
  \ to make, use, sell,\noffer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,\n\
  in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section\n2.2 shall apply\
  \ to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\nif, at the time the Contribution\
  \ is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents\
  \ to be infringed\nby such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is\ngranted\
  \ under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not\ninclude the Contributor Version,\
  \ as it exists and is used in accordance\nwith the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused\
  \ by: (i) third party\nmodifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of\n\
  Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except\nas part of the Contributor\
  \ Version) or other devices; or (c) with\nrespect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program\
  \ in the absence of\nContributions made by that Contributor.\n\n2.3 Recipient understands\
  \ that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein,\
  \ except as provided in\nSection 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the\n\
  Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\nrights of any other person\
  \ or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\nliability to Recipient for claims brought by\
  \ any other person or entity\nbased on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.\
  \ As a\ncondition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\nRecipient\
  \ hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\nintellectual property rights needed,\
  \ if any.\n\n2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right,\ntitle and\
  \ interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the\nright to grant the copyright\
  \ licenses set forth in this License.\n\n3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If the Program\
  \ is distributed in object code form, then a prominent\nnotice must be included in the code\
  \ itself as well as in any related\ndocumentation, stating that the source code for the Program\
  \ is available\nfrom the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the\nsource\
  \ code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in\nobject code form under its\
  \ own license agreement, provided that:\n\na. it complies with the terms and conditions of\
  \ this License; and \nb. its license agreement: \n\ti. effectively disclaims on behalf of\
  \ all Contributors all warranties and \n\tconditions, express and implied, including warranties\
  \ or conditions of title\n\tand non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of\
  \ \n\tmerchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent\n\tpermitted\
  \ by applicable law;\n\tii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\
  \ for \n\tdamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential \n\t\
  damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable\n\tlaw; \n\t\
  iii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are\n\toffered by\
  \ that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and \n\tiv. states that source code for\
  \ the Program is available from such \n\tContributor at the cost of distribution, and informs\
  \ licensees how to obtain\n\tit in a reasonable manner.\n\n3.2 When the Program is made available\
  \ in source code form:\n\na. it must be made available under this License; and \nb. a copy\
  \ of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n3.3 This License is intended\
  \ to facilitate the commercial distribution\nof the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors\
  \ may only charge\nRecipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.\n\
  Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license\nfee, or any ongoing\
  \ royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights\nunder this License to the Program. Contributors\
  \ shall make the source\ncode for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost,\
  \ if\nany, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and\ndistribute the work.\
  \ It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a\nContributor from charging fees for any\
  \ service or maintenance that a\nContributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees\
  \ are not an\nattempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties\nor other\
  \ recurring fees for the Program itself.\n\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by\
  \ combining the Program with\nother software code not governed by the terms of this License,\
  \ and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the\nContributor must\
  \ make sure that the requirements of this License are\nfulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor\
  \ who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering, including as part of a Larger\
  \ Work, may\nsubject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual\ncommitments,\
  \ including, but not limited to, performance warranties and\nnon-infringement representations\
  \ on suchContributors behalf. No\nContributor may create any additional liability for other\
  \ Contributors.\nTherefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product\n\
  offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to\ndefend and indemnify\
  \ every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)\nwho made Contributions to the Program\
  \ distributed by the Commercial\nContributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively\
  \ Losses)\narising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\nparty\
  \ against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\nacts or omissions, including\
  \ any additional contractual commitments, of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with\
  \ its distribution of the\nProgram. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\
  \ or\nLosses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement.\n\n3.5\
  \ If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys\nintellectual property\
  \ rights is required to exercise the rights granted\nby such Contributor under Sections 2.1\
  \ or 2.2, Contributor must (a)\ninclude a text file with the Program source code distribution\
  \ titled\n../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates\nInternational,\
  \ Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York\n11749, Attn: Open Source Group\
  \ or by email at opensource@ca.com, both\ndescribing the claim and the party making the claim\
  \ in sufficient detail\nthat a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such\n\
  matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is\nmade available, Contributor\
  \ shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES\nfile in all copies Contributor makes available\
  \ thereafter and shall take\nother steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n\
  reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such\nnew knowledge has\
  \ been obtained.\n\n3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other\nContributor\
  \ copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the\nProgram, whether in the source\
  \ code, object code or in any\ndocumentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in\
  \ Section 4,\neach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution,\
  \ if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator\
  \ of the Contribution.\n\n4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\n\n4.1 Each Contributor must cause\
  \ the Program to which the Contributor\nprovides a Contribution to contain a file documenting\
  \ the changes the\nContributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of\n\
  any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement\nthat the Contribution\
  \ is derived, directly or indirectly, from the\nProgram distributed by a prior Contributor,\
  \ including the name of the\nprior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in\
  \ (a) the\nProgram source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or\nrelated\
  \ documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or\nownership of the Program.\n\
