2.2        Documentation. Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement, Licensee may reproduce the Documentation, for use on an internal basis only, and solely in support of the Licensee’s licensed use of the Software. Distribution of the Documentation outside of Licensee is prohibited without
the express written permission of SOLACE. Licensee must reproduce all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the Documentation.

2.3        Back-up Copy.  In addition to the number of copies of the Software installed and used pursuant to Section 2.1 and paid for in accordance with Section 5, Licensee may make one copy of each licensed Product per Subscription solely for back-up purposes, provided that Licensee reproduces all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the Software and such back-up copy is not installed or used other than for back-up and recovery purposes.  Back-up copies that are used as part of a live or ‘hot’ back-up will be subject to additional fees.

2.4        Use Restrictions. Licensee will not: (a) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or translate the Software (other than Sample Applications), or otherwise attempt to derive the source code version of the Software, except if and only to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, and provided that Licensee first approaches SOLACE and seeks permission in writing; (b) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, rent, lease, loan or otherwise in any manner provide, transfer or distribute the Products or any part thereof to any third party; (c) use the Software in violation of applicable laws; (d) circumvent any user limits or other license timing or use restrictions that are built into the Software; and (e) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display or create adaptations or derivative works of or based on the Products.

(c)         If  Licensee  desires  other  rights  for  the  Evaluation  Software  Release,  Licensee  must request from SOLACE a commercial release of the Software.

(d)         The limited use license granted in subsection (a) will automatically expire on the earlier of: (i) the date when the Software is made available to Licensee as a commercially available product, and (ii) the date specified in the Order or, if no such date is identified in the Order, the date that is 30 days after the date of delivery or provision of the Evaluation Software Release to Licensee.

(b)         Whether provided separately or together with other Software, if SOLACE provides such Sample Application to Licensee, then SOLACE hereby grants to Licensee a non- sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license, to install such Sample Application for Licensee’s evaluation for the same duration as the Software with which

3.2	Support.

(a)        Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement, SOLACE will provide Support and Maintenance Services the Software in accordance with SOLACE’s then standard Support and Maintenance Terms.

or will cause all moral rights to be waived in any Feedback.

4.3        Third Party Licenses.  The Software may contain or require third party software that is licensed under third party terms.   SOLACE may direct Licensee to such third party terms, and in some instances the Software cannot be used or further distributed without Licensee’s acceptance of such terms.  Any failure of Licensee to agree to the terms applicable to such third party software may undermine certain functionality of or prevent Licensee from using the Software.

4.4	Open Source Software.

(a)         Licensee will not represent to third parties, or use any third party software or code in conjunction with: (i) the Software; or (ii) any software, products, documentation, content or other materials developed using the Software, in such a way that: (A) creates, purports to create or has the potential to create, obligations for SOLACE with respect to the Software; or (B) grants, purports to grant, or has the potential to grant to any third party any rights to or immunities under any Intellectual Property Rights of SOLACE, as such rights exist in or relate to the Products.

(b)         Licensee will not use any Software in any manner, including through incorporation, linking, distribution or otherwise, that will cause any Products and any Intellectual Property Rights therein to become subject to any encumbrance or terms and conditions of any third party or open source license, including any open source license listed on http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical (each an “Open Source License”).

(c)         The restrictions, limitations, exclusions and conditions referred to under subsection (b) will apply even if SOLACE becomes aware of or fails to act in a manner to address any violation or failure to comply therewith. No act by SOLACE that is undertaken under this Agreement in respect to any Products will be construed as intending to cause any Intellectual Property Rights that are owned or controlled by SOLACE or any of its affiliates (or for which SOLACE or any of its affiliates has received license rights) to become subject to any encumbrance or terms and conditions of any Open Source License.

4.5	Use of Name and Logo.  Licensee will not display or make any use of SOLACE’s or its affiliates’
names, marks or logos without the prior written approval of SOLACE.

5	FEES AND TAXES

5.1        Fees. Licensee shall pay the applicable Subscription Fees and support fees specified in the applicable Order.

Subscription Fees paid are refundable if the number of Subscriptions purchased are decreased during the relevant Subscription Term.

5.2        Invoices and Payment. Subscription Fees will be invoiced in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order. All invoices issued by SOLACE are due and payable within 30 days of the invoice date unless otherwise agreed in an Order.  Licensee will be responsible for any and all
sales, use, excise, import, value-added, services, consumption, and other taxes assessed on the receipt of the Products, and any related services as a whole.

5.3        Overdue Charges. Any payment not received from Customer by the due date may accrue (except with respect to charges then subject to a reasonable and good faith dispute), at Licensor&#39; discretion, late charges at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month (19.57% per annum), or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.

6	CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1	Definition of Confidential Information.

In this Agreement “Confidential Information” of a Party means any information of a Party (including in respect to SOLACE any of its affiliates, licensors, customers, employees or subcontractors) (the “Disclosing Party”), whether oral, written or in electronic form, which has or will come into the possession or knowledge of the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) in connection with or as a result of entering into this Agreement that can reasonably be considered to be confidential in the circumstances of disclosure or which is designated as confidential. The Products, any performance information, service levels, support terms, and results of testing of the Software, and the terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information of SOLACE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Confidential Information” does not include information that is:

(a)         publicly available when it is received by or becomes known to the Receiving Party or that subsequently becomes publicly available other than through a direct or indirect act or omission of the Receiving Party (but only after it becomes publicly available);

(b)         established by evidence to have been already known to the Receiving Party at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party and is not known by the Receiving Party to be the subject of an obligation of confidence of any kind;

(c)         independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of or reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as established by evidence that would be acceptable to a court of competent jurisdiction;

(d)         received by the Receiving Party in good faith without an obligation of confidence of any kind from a third party who the Receiving Party had no reason to believe was not lawfully in possession of such information free of any obligation of confidence of any kind, but only until the Receiving Party subsequently comes to have reason to believe that such information was subject to an obligation of confidence of any kind when originally received; or

(e)         Feedback provided by Licensee or a representative of Licensee.

6.2	Confidentiality Obligations.

(a)         Each Party will, in its capacity as a Receiving Party: (i) not use or reproduce Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose, other than as may be reasonably necessary for the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations set out in this
Agreement; and (ii) not disclose, provide access to, transfer or otherwise make available any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.

(b)         Each Party may, in its capacity as a Receiving Party, disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party: (i) if and to the extent required by a governmental authority or otherwise as required by applicable law, provided that the Receiving Party must first give the Disclosing Party notice of such compelled disclosure (except where prohibited by applicable law from doing so) and must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Disclosing Party with an opportunity to take such steps as it desires to challenge or contest such disclosure or seek a protective order.  Thereafter, the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, but only to the extent required by applicable law and subject to any protective order that applies to such disclosure; and (ii) to: (A) its accountants, internal and external auditors and other professional advisors if and to the extent that such persons need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide the applicable professional advisory services relating to the Receiving Party; and (B) employees of the Receiving Party and its subcontractors if and to the extent that such persons need to know such Confidential Information to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement;

provided that any such person is aware of the provisions of this Section 6.2 and has entered into a written agreement with the Receiving Party that includes confidentiality obligations in respect of such Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that are no less stringent than those contained in this Section 6.2.

6.3        Consent to Injunctive Relief. Any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of SOLACE, its affiliates or licensors may cause irreparable harm and significant injury to SOLACE that would be difficult to ascertain or quantify; accordingly Licensee agrees that SOLACE will have the right to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement and without limiting any other rights or remedies that SOLACE may have.

(e)	Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so exclusions in this

8	LICENSEE INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSION.

8.1	Licensee Indemnity.

(a)        Without limiting SOLACE’s rights and remedies under this Agreement, Licensee will indemnify, defend and hold SOLACE, its licensors, affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents (together, the “Solace Indemnitees”) harmless from and against any and all third party Claims and Losses incurred or otherwise suffered by each SOLACE Indemnitee arising out of, resulting from or related to:

(i)         any use, reproduction or distribution of the Products (notwithstanding the restrictions and obligations in this Agreement), as modified or integrated by Licensee in Licensee application, which causes an infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right, publicity or privacy right of any third parties arising in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world, except and
solely to the extent such infringement is caused by the unmodified Software, or portions thereof, as supplied to Licensee by SOLACE under this Agreement; or

(ii)	any use, downloading, distribution, installation, storage, execution, or transfer of the Products in breach of this Agreement.

(b)         SOLACE may enforce the indemnity under this Article 8 on behalf of any or all of the SOLACE Indemnitees.  Licensee may only bring a Claim against SOLACE and not any SOLACE Indemnitees under this Agreement.

8.2	SOLACE Indemnity.

(a)         SOLACE will defend Licensee from and against any and all Claims by a third party incurred or otherwise suffered by Licensee arising out of, resulting from or related to a Claim that the Products licensed pursuant to Section 2.1 infringe or misappropriate third party copyright or patent rights in Canada or the United States of America, and indemnity Licensee from any damages awarded by a court of final determination.

(b)         Without limitation, Section 8.2 will not be applicable and SOLACE will not be liable to defend a Claim to the extent that such Claim is based on: (i) Licensee’s use of the Products after SOLACE notifies Licensee to discontinue using them; (ii) Licensee combining the Products with non-SOLACE services, products, programs or data; or (iii) Licensee altering or modifying the Products.

(c)         If SOLACE receives information concerning an infringement or misappropriation Claim related to the Products, SOLACE may, at its expense and without obligation to do so, either: (i) procure the Intellectual Property Rights or other right(s) to continue to use the Product; or (ii) replace or modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) immediately terminate this Agreement on written notice to Licensee, in which case SOLACE will refund to Licensee, on a pro-rata basis, any pre-paid fees in respect to such Product from the date of such termination to the end of the then current Subscription Term for such Product; and this Section 8.2(c) states the sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee and the entire liability of SOLACE for third party infringement claims and actions.

8.3        Indemnification Procedures. Each Party’s obligations under this Article 8 are contingent on all of the following: (i) the Party seeking the indemnity (the “Indemnified Party”) must notify the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”), in a timely manner and in writing of the Claim; (ii) the Indemnified Party must give the Indemnifying Party sole control over defense and settlement of the Claim; (iii) the Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable information and assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s request, as needed in defending the Claim (the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable expenses that the Indemnified Party incurs in providing that assistance). The Indemnified Party may choose to have its counsel, monitor or participate in the defense of such a Claim provided that the Indemnified Party will be responsible for the cost of its own counsel and the Indemnifying Party’s obligations in this Article 8 do not extend to the Indemnified Party’s legal costs should it wish to exercise such right. The Indemnifying Party will not be responsible for any settlement made by the Indemnified
Claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent.

13.1      U.S. Government Users.  If Licensee are acting on behalf of an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. federal government, the Product, as applicable, are “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” developed exclusively at private expense by SOLACE.  Pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFARS 227 7202 and their successors, as applicable, use, reproduction and disclosure of the Products is governed by the terms of this Agreement.

13.2      Entire Agreement. This Agreement, and the agreements and other documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between SOLACE and Licensee, and sets out all the covenants, promises, warranties, representations, conditions and agreements between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements (whether written or oral, pre-contractual or otherwise) and other communications between SOLACE and Licensee. There are no covenants, promises, warranties, representations, conditions or other agreements, whether oral or written, pre-contractual or otherwise, express, implied or collateral, whether statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement except as specifically set forth in this Agreement and any document required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

13.3      Amendments. This Agreement may be modified only by a written amendment agreed to by both Licensee and SOLACE, except that SOLACE may modify the Documentation from time to time, provided that SOLACE does not materially lessen the description of the functionality of the Products as a result of such modification.

13.4      English Language. This Agreement is entered into solely in the English language, and if for any reason any other language version is prepared by any Party, it will be solely for convenience and the English version will govern and control in all respects.  If Licensee are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following applies:  The Parties hereby confirm they have requested this Agreement and all related documents be prepared in English. Les parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.

13.5      Waiver. To be effective, any waiver by a Party of any of its rights or any other Party’s obligations under this Agreement must be made in a writing signed by the Party to be charged with the waiver. No failure or forbearance by any Party to insist upon or enforce performance by any other Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity will be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect.  A Party’s waiver
of a breach of any term will not be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or another term.

13.6     Cumulative Rights. The rights of each Party hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or enforcement by a Party of any right or remedy hereunder will preclude the exercise or enforcement by such Party of any other right or remedy hereunder or which such Party is otherwise entitled by law to enforce.

13.7      Severability. If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Agreement or its application to any Party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or unenforceable, the provision will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of the restriction, prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction, or without affecting its application to other Parties or circumstances.

13.8      Assignment. SOLACE may assign this Agreement or any of the benefits, rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Licensee.  Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any of the benefits, rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of SOLACE. Any attempt by Licensee to so assign or transfer is null and void. If SOLACE does consent to an assignment of this Agreement, the transferee/assignee must be acceptable to SOLACE and agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

13.9      Further Assurances. The Parties will, with reasonable diligence, do all things and provide all such reasonable assurances as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will provide such further documents or instruments required by any other Party as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the purpose of this Agreement and carry out its provisions.

13.10    Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. Any Claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in a federal or provincial court located in Ottawa, Canada, and Licensee hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defence of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, application or proceeding. The Parties will not raise any objection to the venue of any action, application, reference or other proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement in the federal or provincial courts sitting in Ottawa, including the objection that the proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. A final judgment in any such action, application or proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner specified by law.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed and will not apply.</code></pre>
