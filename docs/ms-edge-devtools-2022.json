Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.\n\n7)\tENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.\n\n8)\tAPPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\n\na)\tAustralia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\nb)\tCanada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\nc)\tGermany and Austria. \ni)\tWarranty.

In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\n\n10)\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED \u201cAS IS.\u201d YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
