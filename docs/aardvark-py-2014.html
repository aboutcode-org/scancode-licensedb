Aardvark I2C/SPI Software and Firmware

PREAMBLE:
  The accompanying software, firmware, documentation, and related
  materials (&#34;Product&#34;) are the sole property of Total Phase, Inc.
  (&#34;Total Phase&#34;).  Its use and distribution is subject to the
  terms in this License Agreement (&#34;Agreement&#34;).

  By the use or distribution of the Product, you are consenting to
  be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  If you do not agree, do
  not use or distribute the Product in whole or in part.


TERMS OF USE:
  Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Product
  is hereby granted, subject to the conditions stated below:

  a. The Product is licensed only for use with other Total Phase
     products.  Any other use is permitted only with the express
     written permission of Total Phase.

  b. The Product may only be copied unmodified in its entirety,
     with all of the files intact including a verbatim copy of this
     Agreement.  Distribution of modified copies is permitted only
     with the express written permission of Total Phase.

  c. The Product must not be placed on any publicly-accessible
     Internet server including, but not limited to, web servers, ftp
     servers, and file sharing systems.  Instead, a link should be
     placed to the Total Phase website where the latest versions
     may be obtained.

  d. As a special exemption, a copy of the shared object file,
     aardvark.dll or aardvark.so (&#34;Shared Object File&#34;), may be
     distributed separately from the Product, provided that it is part
     of a separate work (&#34;Separate Work&#34;).  Such Shared Object Files
     carry with them all of the rights and limitations outlined in
     this Agreement, except that it may not be further distributed
     unless part of the Separate Work.

     Before publicly distributing the Shared Object Files, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must notify Total Phase by electronic
     mail to: sales@totalphase.com to the attention of General
     Manager. Provide a description of the Separate Work, specifically
     mentioning how any Total Phase hardware and the Shared Object
     Files will be integrated into the Separate Work and your proposed
     method of distribution. Total Phase will acknowledge the
     notification within one week.

     You are required to include a copy of this Agreement with your
     Separate Work.

  e. Any separate works which include the Product must be plainly
     marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as the original
     software.

  f. You may not modify, translate, reverse-engineer, decompile,
     disassemble (except and solely to the extent that an applicable
     statute expressly and specifically prohibits such restrictions),
     or create derivative works of the Product.  A separate work
     that only makes use of the unmodified shared object file is not
     considered a derivative work.


PROPRIETARY RIGHTS:
  The Product is owned by Total Phase and is protected by United
  States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  All
  copyright, patent, trade secret, trademarks, and other intellectual
  and proprietary rights in the Product are and shall remain the
  valuable property of Total Phase.  You agree to take all necessary
  steps to ensure that this property is protected and that the
  provisions of this Agreement are not violated by you or by any
  person under your control or in your service.


TERMINATION:
  Your rights under this license will terminate automatically if you
  fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  If any provision of this license agreement is held to be
  unenforceable, that provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable; and the balance of this license
  agreement shall remain in full force and effect.


SAFETY-CRITICAL SYSTEMS POLICY:
  The Product is not authorized for use in life support devices or
  systems.  Life support devices or systems include, but are not
  limited to, surgical implants, medical systems, and other
  safety-critical systems in which failure of a Total Phase product
  could cause personal injury or loss of life.

  The Product is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured
  or intended for use or resale in hazardous environments requiring
  fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities,
  aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control,
  or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Product could lead
  directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environ-
  mental damage.  Such use is unauthorized by Total Phase.

  Should the Product be used in any such unauthorized manner, Buyer
  agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Total Phase, its officers,
  employees, affiliates, and distributors from any and all claims
  arising from such use, even if such claim alleges that Total Phase
  was negligent in the design or manufacture of the Product.


OPEN SOURCE:
  The software API portion of the Product makes use of open source
  libraries that are not owned by Total Phase and are licensed under
  different terms.  For specific details, please see the documentation
  that is included with the software API package.


DISCLAIMER:
  THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &#34;AS IS,&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER(S) AND TOTAL PHASE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL
  WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

  OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AND DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR
  ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT
  OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR
  BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
