Posted Date:  December 19, 2018

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THIS TIMESCALE LICENSE AGREEMENT (&#34;TSL Agreement&#34;), WHICH
CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT AND GOVERNS USE OF THE TIMESCALE
TIME-SERIES DATABASE SOFTWARE AND RELATED SOFTWARE THAT IS PROVIDED SUBJECT TO
THIS TSL AGREEMENT.  BY INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU
HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL
AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT
INSTALL OR USE SUCH SOFTWARE.  IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE ON
BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT
LEGAL ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO BIND THAT LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS TSL AGREEMENT.

This TSL Agreement is entered into by and between Timescale, Inc. (&#34;Timescale&#34;)
and you or the legal entity on whose behalf you are accepting this TSL
Agreement (&#34;You&#34;).

0. BACKGROUND

   The Timescale time-series database software and related software is offered
   as &#34;open code&#34; or &#34;source-available&#34; code.  This means that all source code
   of the software is available for inspection and download at
   https://github.com/timescale.  The Timescale software is composed of two
   major pieces.

   The first, core piece (referred to herein as the Timescale Open Source
   Software, as defined below) is open source software that is licensed under
   the Apache Version 2.0 license.

   The second piece (referred to herein as the TSL Licensed Software, as
   defined below) is all of the Timescale Software other than the Timescale
   Open Source Software.

   Certain functions or features of the TSL Licensed Software (referred to
   herein as Community Features, as defined below) may be used under this TSL
   Agreement without charge, in some cases subject to certain usage limits that
   may be imposed by a software license key and/or technical restrictions in
   the code.

   Certain other functions or features of the TSL Licensed Software (referred
   to herein as Enterprise Features, as defined below) may be used either
   solely under a Commercial License Agreement subject to charge, or under this
   TSL Agreement without charge only for a limited time trial period.  In order
   to use such features, You must obtain an appropriate license key.

   You may find more information at https://www.timescale.com/pricing about
   which functions and features of the TSL Licensed Software are classified as
   Community Features and Enterprise Features, details about any applicable
   usage limits and trial periods, and a description of how You can obtain any
   required license keys and enter into a Commercial License Agreement with
   Timescale.

1. GOVERNING LICENSES

   1.1 Source Code.  The source code for all Timescale Software is made
   publicly available by Timescale at https://github.com/timescale.  However,
   different license agreements govern the use of different parts of the
   Timescale Software source code.  The use of Timescale Open Source Software,
   in both source and executable forms, is governed by the terms of the Apache
   License Version 2.0, a copy of which is available at
   https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.  The use of all other Timescale
   Software in source code form is governed by this TSL Agreement and/or a
   Commercial License Agreement, as applicable.

   1.2 Commercial License Rights.  If You desire to use Community Features
   beyond applicable Usage Limits, or to use Enterprise Features beyond an
   applicable trial period (or those Enterprise Features that are not available
   for use under this TSL Agreement at all), as the case may be, You must
   obtain an appropriate License Key and enter into a Commercial License
   Agreement with Timescale, subject to applicable charges.

   1.3 License Rights to Your Customers.  As set forth in Section 2.1 below,
   the use by Your customers of the Timescale Software as part of any Value
   Added Products or Services that You distribute will be subject to the most
   current version of this TSL Agreement, including any applicable Usage Limits
   and restrictions on the use of Enterprise Features.  If Your customers
   desire to use any functions or features of the Timescale Software beyond
   applicable Usage Limits, or to use Enterprise Features, they must enter into
   a Commercial License Agreement with Timescale and obtain any necessary
   License Keys.

2. GRANT OF LICENSES

   2.1 Grant.  Conditioned upon compliance with all of the terms and conditions
   of this TSL Agreement, Timescale grants to You at no charge the following
   limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid up, worldwide licenses,
   without the right to grant or authorize sublicenses (except as set forth in
   Section 2.3):

      (a) Internal Use.  A license to copy, compile, install, and use the
      Timescale Software in unmodified form: (i) solely for Your own internal

      directly or indirectly (e.g., via a wrapper), the Timescale Data
      Definition Interfaces or the Timescale Data Manipulation Interfaces to
      any person or entity other than You or Your employees and Contractors
      working on Your behalf, and (ii) solely in compliance with all applicable
      Usage Limits and any limits imposed on the use of Enterprise Features by
      a License Key or the Timescale Software itself.  You agree not to use the
      Community Features in any manner or extent beyond the Usage Limits or use
      the Enterprise Features in any manner or extent beyond the limits imposed
      by a License Key or the Timescale Software itself, except as may be
      permitted by a Commercial License Agreement that You and Timescale may
      enter into.

      (b) Value Added Products or Services.  A license (i) to copy, compile,
      install, and use the Timescale Software solely in unmodified form to
      develop and maintain Your Value Added Products or Services, and (ii) to
      utilize (in the case of services) or distribute (in the case of products
      that are distributed to Your customers) copies of the Timescale Software
      or parts thereof solely in unmodified form and solely as incorporated
      into or utilized with Your Value Added Products or Services; provided
      that (1) You notify Your customers that use of such Timescale Software is
      subject to this TSL Agreement and You provide to each such customer a

      which the most current version of this TSL Agreement may be obtained, and
      (2) the customer is prohibited, either contractually or technically, from
      defining, redefining, or modifying the database schema or other
      structural aspects of database objects, such as through use of the
      Timescale Data Definition Interfaces, in a Timescale Database utilized by
      such Value Added Products or Services.

      (c) Distribution of Source Code or Binaries in Standalone Form.  Subject
      to the prohibitions in Section 2.2 below, a license to copy and
      distribute the Timescale Software Source Code and the Timescale Software
      Binaries solely in unmodified standalone form and subject to the terms
      and conditions of the most current version of this TSL Agreement.  You
      may not distribute the TSL Licensed Software Source Code or the TSL
      Licensed Software Binaries in combination with or for use with any other
      software except for Your Value Added Products or Services.

      (d) Derivative Works.  A license to prepare, compile, and test Derivative
      Works of the TSL Licensed Software Source Code solely in a Non-Production

      or outside a Non-Production Environment, (ii) such Derivative Works do
      not violate any of the prohibitions on circumvention of Technological
      Protection Measures set forth in Section 2.5, and (iii) such Derivative
      Works are not distributed to any third person or entity other than as a
      contribution back to Timescale under Timescale&#39;s Contributor Agreement
      for potential incorporation into Timescale&#39;s maintained code base at its
      sole discretion.

   2.2 Prohibitions.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this TSL
   Agreement, You are prohibited from (i) using any TSL Licensed Software to
   provide time-sharing services or database-as-a-service services, or to
   provide any form of software-as-a-service or service offering in which the
   TSL Licensed Software is offered or made available to third parties to
   provide time-series database functions or operations, other than as part of
   Your Value Added Products or Services, or (ii) copying or distributing any
   TSL Licensed Software for use in any of the foregoing ways.  In addition,
   You agree not to, except as expressly permitted in Section 2.1(d), prepare
   Derivative Works of any TSL Licensed Software or, except as expressly
   permitted herein, transfer, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, loan, or
   otherwise transfer or make available any TSL Licensed Software, whether in
   source code or binary executable form.  If You have any question as to
   whether a specific use You intend to make of the TSL Licensed Software
   complies with the foregoing prohibitions, please contact
   licensing@timescale.com.

   2.3 Affiliates and Contractors.  You may permit Your Contractors and
   Affiliates to exercise the licenses set forth in Section 2.1, provided that
   such exercise by Contractors must be solely for your benefit and/or the
   benefit of Your Affiliates, and You shall be responsible for all acts and
   omissions of such Contractors and Affiliates in connection with such
   exercise of the licenses, including but not limited to breach of any
   applicable Usage Limits, limits imposed by a License Key, or other terms of
   this TSL Agreement.

   2.4 Reservation of Rights.  Except as expressly set forth in Section 2.1, no
   other license or rights to the Timescale Software are granted to You under
   this TSL Agreement, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

   PERFORMANCE OR FAILURE TO PERFORM THIS TSL AGREEMENT, OR THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE TIMESCALE SOFTWARE, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF
   CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY
   OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF TIMESCALE HAS BEEN ADVISED OR IS AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. GENERAL

   8.1 Complete Agreement.  This TSL Agreement completely and exclusively
   states the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter
   hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, or other
   communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject
   matter.

   8.2 Modification.  This TSL Agreement may be modified by Timescale from time
   to time, and any such modifications will be effective upon the &#34;Posted Date&#34;
   set forth at the top of the modified agreement. The modified agreement shall
   govern any new version of the TSL Licensed Software (and all its constituent
   source code and binaries) that is officially released as a complete version
   release by Timescale on or after such Posted Date. Except as set forth in
   this Section 8.2, this TSL Agreement may not be amended except by a writing
   executed by both parties.

   8.3 Governing Law.  This TSL Agreement shall be governed by and construed
   solely under the laws of the State of New York, without application of any
   choice of law rules or principles that would lead to the applicability of
   the law of any other jurisdiction.  None of the provisions of either the
   United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
   or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall apply.

   8.4 Unenforceability.  If any provision of this TSL Agreement is held
   unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this TSL Agreement shall remain
   in effect and the unenforceable provision shall be replaced by an
   enforceable provision that best reflects the original intent of the parties.

   8.5 Injunctive Relief.  You acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach
   of any provision of this TSL Agreement will cause irreparable harm to
   Timescale for which damages at law will not provide adequate relief, and
   Timescale shall therefore be entitled to injunctive relief against such
   breach or threatened breach without being required to post a bond.

   8.6 Assignment.  You may not assign this TSL Agreement, including by
   operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition or otherwise, in
   whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Timescale, which
   Timescale may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.  Any
   assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void.

   8.7 Independent Contractors.  The parties to this TSL Agreement are
   independent contractors and this TSL Agreement does not establish any
   relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency
   between the parties.

   8.8 U.S. Government Rights.  The Timescale Software and related
   documentation are &#34;Commercial Items&#34;, as that term is defined at 48
   C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of &#34;Commercial Computer Software&#34; and &#34;Commercial
   Computer Software Documentation,&#34; as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48
   C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable,
   the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software
   Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as
   Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other
   end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this TSL Agreement.
