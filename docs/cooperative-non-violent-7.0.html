an intention to provoke a conflict or an action that occurs during a
declared war or during armed conflict between military forces of any
origin. This includes but is not limited to enforcing sanctions or
sieges, supplying armed forces, or profiting from the manufacture of
tools or weaponry used in military conflict.

An Adaptation is a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic
work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic
adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image (\&#34;synching\&#34;) will be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License. In addition, where the Work is designed to
output a neural network the output of the neural network will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this license.

with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely
transient or trifling in nature.

photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a

uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

# License Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

To Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
Collections

To create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \&#34;The
original work was translated from English to Spanish,\&#34; or a
modification could indicate \&#34;The original work has been modified.\&#34;

To Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

To Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work
not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License
may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor
and You. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes, Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes, and Voluntary License Schemes in the restrictions.

# Restrictions

The license granted in the license grant above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collection any credit as requested. If You create an
Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as requested.

the following requirements.

i.  You are a worker-owned business or worker-owned collective.

ii. after tax, all financial gain, surplus, profits and benefits
    produced by the business or collective are distributed among the
    worker-owners unless a set amount is to be allocated towards

    agreement between the worker-owners where all worker-owners agreed.

iii. You are not using such rights on behalf of a business other than
     those specified in (i) or (ii) above, nor are using such rights as
     a proxy on behalf of a business with the intent to circumvent the
     aforementioned restrictions on such a business.

The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation,
provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection
with the exchange of copyrighted works.

If the Work meets the definition of Software, You may exercise the
rights granted in the license grant only if You provide a copy of the
corresponding Source Code from which the Work was derived in digital
form, or You provide a URI for the corresponding Source Code of the
Work, to any recipients upon request.

If the Work is used as or for a Network Service, You may exercise the
rights granted in the license grant only if You provide a copy of the
corresponding Source Code from which the Work was derived in digital
form, or You provide a URI for the corresponding Source Code to the
Work, to any recipients of the data served or modified by the Web
Service.

Any use by a business that is privately owned and managed, and that
seeks to generate profit from the labor of employees paid by salary or
other wages, is not permitted under this license.

## 

You may exercise the rights granted in the license grant for any
purposes only if:

    or refining, oil, gas, or coal. Or to in any other way to
    deliberately pollute the environment as a byproduct of manufacturing
    or irresponsible disposal of hazardous materials.

vii. You do not use the Work for the purpose of expediting,
     coordinating, or facilitating paid work undertaken by individuals
     under the age of 12 years.

viii. You do not use the Work to either Discriminate or spread Hate
      Speech on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,
      race, age, disability, color, national origin, religion, caste, or
      lower economic status.

## 

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made by any Licensor to
remove credit from a Collection or Adaptation, keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
are utilizing:

i.  the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution (\&#34;Attribution Parties\&#34;) in
    Licensor\&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;

ii. the title of the Work if supplied;

iii. to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that
     Licensor to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
     refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and,

iv. in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \&#34;French translation of the Work by
    Original Author,\&#34; or \&#34;Screenplay based on original Work by
    Original Author\&#34;).

If any Licensor has sent notice to request removing credit, You must, to
the extent practicable, remove any credit as requested. The credit
required by this Section may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of an Adaptation or Collection, at a
minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in
the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Commercial
Restrictions and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through
any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under the license grant.

Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
the Original Author\&#39;shonor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
in the license grant of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other
derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author\&#39;s honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this
Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law,
to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under the license grant
of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

Do not make any legal claim against anyone accusing the Work, with or
without changes, alone or with other works, of infringing any patent
claim.

# Representations Warranties and Disclaimer

LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

# Limitation on Liability

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

# Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. The Sections on definitions, fair
dealing rights, representations, warranties, and disclaimer, limitation
on liability, termination, and revised license versions will survive any
termination of this License.

Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

This License may receive future revisions in the original spirit of the
license intended to strengthen This License. Each version of This
License has an incrementing version number.

only granted this current version of This License for The Work. In this
case future revisions do not apply.

License be used for The Work by either explicitly writing so or by
suffixing the License URI with a \&#34;+\&#34; symbol.

The Licensor may specify that The Work is also available under the terms
of This License\&#39;s current revision as well as specific future
revisions. The Licensor may do this by writing it explicitly or
suffixing the License URI with any additional version numbers each
separated by a comma.
