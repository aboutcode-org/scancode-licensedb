text: "Open Web Foundation\nFinal Specification Agreement\n(OWFa 1.0.1) modified May 2023 \n\
  (Patent and Copyright Grants)\n\n1. The Purpose of this Agreement.\n\nThis Agreement sets\
  \ forth the terms under which I make certain copyright and patent rights available to you\
  \ for your Permitted Uses of the Specification. Capitalized terms are defined in the Agreement’s\
  \ last section.\n\n2. Copyrights.\n\n2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for\
  \ the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,\
  \ copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative\
  \ works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement the\
  \ Specification to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Specification.\n\n2.2.\
  \ Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the\
  \ Specification in any derivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution\
  \ must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.\n\n3. Patents.\n\n\
  3.1. Patent Non-Assert.\n\n3.1.1. The Promise. I, on behalf of myself and my successors in\
  \ interest and assigns, irrevocably promise not to assert my Granted Claims against you for\
  \ your Permitted Uses, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 3.1. This is a personal\
  \ promise directly from me to you, and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from it\
  \ that no rights from me are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise in connection\
  \ with this promise. This promise also applies to your Permitted Uses of any other specifications\
  \ incorporating all required portions of the Specification.\n\n3.1.2. Termination.\n\n3.1.2.1.\
  \ As a Result of Claims by You. All rights, grants, and promises made by me to you under this\
  \ Agreement are terminated if you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit\
  \ against me or any person or entity asserting that its Permitted Uses infringe any Granted\
  \ Claims you would have had the right to enforce had you not signed this Agreement, unless\
  \ that suit was in response to a corresponding suit first brought against you.\n\n3.1.2.2.\
  \ As a Result of Claims by a Related Entity of Mine. If a Related Entity of mine files, maintains,\
  \ or voluntarily participates in a lawsuit asserting that a Permitted Use infringes any Granted\
  \ Claims it would have had the right to enforce had it not signed this Agreement, then I relinquish\
  \ any rights, grants, and promises I have received for the Specification from other signatories\
  \ of this Agreement, unless a) my promise to you was terminated pursuant to section 3.1.2.1,\
  \ or b) that suit was in response to a corresponding suit first brought by you against the\
  \ Related Entity.\n\n3.1.3. Additional Conditions. This promise is not an assurance (i) that\
  \ any of my copyrights or issued patent claims cover an implementation of the Specification\
  \ or are enforceable or (ii) that an implementation of the Specification would not infringe\
  \ intellectual property rights of any third party. Notwithstanding the personal nature of\
  \ my promise, this promise is intended to be binding on any future owner, assignee or exclusive\
  \ licensee to whom has been given the right to enforce any Granted Claims against third parties.\n\
  \n3.1.4. Bankruptcy. Solely for purposes of Section 365(n) of Title 11, United States Bankruptcy\
  \ Code and any equivalent law in any foreign jurisdiction, this promise will be treated as\
  \ if it were a license and you may elect to retain your rights under this promise if I (or\
  \ any owner of any patents or patent applications referenced herein), as a debtor in possession,\
  \ or a bankruptcy trustee, reject this non-assert.\n\n3.2. Patent License Commitment. In addition\
  \ to rights granted in 3.1, on behalf of me and my successors in interest and assigns, I agree\
  \ to grant to you a no charge, royalty free license to my Granted Claims on reasonable and\
  \ non- discriminatory terms, where such license applies only to those Granted Claims infringed\
  \ by the implementation of the Specification, solely for your Permitted Uses.\n\n4. No Other\
  \ Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, no other\nexpress or implied\
  \ patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this Agreement,\
  \ including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\n\n5. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge\
  \ that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement the\
  \ Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards,\
  \ and that each party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for\
  \ the purpose of enabling competing technologies and standards.\n\n6. Non-Circumvention. I\
  \ agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any\
  \ action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this Agreement.\n\n7. Representations,\
  \ Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that I am legally entitled to grant\
  \ the rights and promises set forth in this Agreement. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE SPECIFICATION\
  \ IS PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification\
  \ is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly disclaim any\
  \ warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability,\
  \ non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification.\
  \ IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF\
  \ INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES\
  \ OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT,\
  \ TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
  \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. All of my obligations under Section 3 regarding the transfer,\
  \ successors in interest, or assignment of Granted Claims will be satisfied if I notify the\
  \ transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Granted Claims of the obligations\
  \ under Section 3. Nothing in this Agreement requires me to undertake a patent search.\n\n\

  \ that entity owns or controls, including those patent claims it acquires or controls after\

  \ in detail, requires infringement, and does not merely reference the functionality causing\
  \ the infringement. Granted Claims do not include patent claims infringed by (a) any enabling\
  \ technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies\
  \ with the Specification, but are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification;\
  \ (b) the implementation or use of other specifications referred to in the body of the Specification,\
  \ even if required for compliance with the Specification; (c) any portions of any product\
  \ and any combinations thereof the purpose or function of which is not required for compliance\
  \ with the Specification; or (d) reference or informational portions of the Specification.\
  \ Granted Claims under this FSA exclude those patent claims that would be infringed by an\
  \ implementation of the Specification if such entity’s Contribution to that Specification\
  \ were removed.\n\n8.5. I, Me, or My.“I,” “me,” or “my” refers to the signatory below and\
  \ its Bound Entities, if applicable.\n\n8.6. Permitted Uses. “Permitted Uses” means making,\
  \ using, selling, offering for sale, importing or distributing any implementation of the Specification\
  \ 1) only to the extent it implements the Specification and 2) so long as all required portions\
  \ of the Specification are implemented. Permitted Uses do not extend to any portion of an\
  \ implementation that is not included in the Specification.\n\n8.7. Related Entities. “Related\
  \ Entities” means 1) any entity that Controls the Bound Entity (“Upstream Entity”), and 2)\
  \ any other entity that is Controlled by an Upstream Entity that is not itself a Bound Entity.\n\
  \n8.8. Specification. “Specification” means the Specification identified below.\n\n8.9. You\
  \ or Your. “You,” “you,” or “your” means any person or entity who exercises copyright or patent\
  \ rights granted under this Agreement, and any person or entity you Control.\n\nIdentify the\
  \ Specification and version number here:\n\nIf signing this OWFa as an individual:\nI acknowledge\
  \ that, depending upon local law or contractual agreements, when I am employed by or acting\

  \ be obligations of that other entity. In such a situation, I represent that I have been authorized\
  \ by that entity to make these promises. I also understand that certain Specification projects\
  \ may require additional private identifying information or certifications from me before\
  \ they accept this Agreement.\n____________________________ Signed name\n____________________________\
