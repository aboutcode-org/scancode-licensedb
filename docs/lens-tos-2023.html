October 16, 2023

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ACCESSING OR CONSUMING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. BY CLICKING YOUR ASSENT OR USING, ACCESSING OR CONSUMING SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS. AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD OR THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

1. THE AGREEMENT

1.1. These terms are collectively an agreement between Mirantis, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with offices at 900 E. Hamilton Ave., Suite 650, Campbell, CA 95008, USA (“Mirantis” sometimes “our” or “we”) and the user of the Mirantis software or services who accepts the terms of this agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, Mirantis provides software and tools for cloud native software development, devops and related purposes (the “Lens Software”), centralized cloud services (“Lens Cloud”), related support and other services (“Lens Services”), provided through and/or marketed at our website at k8slens.dev, including all sub-domains (the “Website”). Except to the extent you and Mirantis have executed a separate agreement, these terms and conditions exclusively govern your access to and use of the Lens Software, Lens Cloud, Lens Services and Website (collectively, the “Services”), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Mirantis (the “Terms”). These Terms, including all Additional Terms referenced in Section 1.2 below, are, collectively, the “Agreement”. If you accept or agree to the Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or other legal entity (a “Legal Entity”), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Legal Entity to the Agreement and, in such event, “Customer” “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity. You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing, purchasing or using the Services, you are indicating that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the Agreement whether or not you have created a Lens ID account. If you do not agree to these Terms and all applicable additional terms, then you have no right to access or use any of the Services.

1.2. The Services are subject to additional terms as shown below (“Additional Terms”). For clarity, unless otherwise indicated in specific Additional Terms, Services are provided by Mirantis.

    1.4. Mirantis may, from time to time, make changes to this Agreement. When such changes are made, Mirantis will make the updated Agreement available and accessible through the Services, or by sending a notice to you via email. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your continued use of any part of the Services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of the modified Agreement. This Agreement may also be superseded by expressly-designated legal notices or terms applicable to specific features or services. These expressly-designated legal notices or terms are incorporated into this Agreement and supersede the provision(s) of this Agreement that are designated as being superseded.

    1.5. For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not cover any Mirantis software other than Lens Software. Other Mirantis software may be distributed and licensed under separate software license terms and any professional services (other than the Services set forth in this Agreement in connection with the Lens Software) will be offered under additional or separate terms.

2. GENERAL USE

2.1. Subject to terms and conditions of this Agreement, Mirantis grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use Services. You may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit Services in any manner.

2.2. The Services are intended for persons above the age to consent to processing in their region (e.g. 13 in the US, 16 in the EU, etc.), however, you must be at least 18 to make purchases. If you are under the age of 18 or whatever is the age of majority where you access the Services, you may make purchases only with the involvement of your legal guardian, and you represent and warrant that your legal guardian has read, understood and agreed to this Agreement.

2.3. If you breach any of the terms of this Agreement, the license described in section 2.1 will terminate automatically and you must immediately stop using all Services, and delete any related downloaded software and printed materials.

3. LENS ID ACCOUNT

3.1. The use of some features of the Services may require signing up and registering for a personal Lens ID account with Mirantis (“Lens ID”). If you choose to register for a Lens ID, you shall provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date registration information. Some Services may exchange your Lens ID login information to authentication keys or tokens (“Tokens”). You are responsible for all use of your Lens ID and for the security of your password and any Tokens that may be used to access and use your Lens ID and you acknowledge that you will be solely and fully responsible for all losses incurred through, or in connection with, access to and use of the Software and Services under such credentials. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Lens ID, you agree to notify Mirantis immediately, change your password, and revoke all tokens.

3.2. Your Lens ID is personal to you and you are allowed to create a single Lens ID for yourself. You are not allowed to create Lens IDs for others and you are not allowed to create multiple Lens IDs for yourself or others.

3.3. Some features of the Services may have usage limits. Mirantis reserves the right to enforce usage limits in its sole discretion. Repeated exceeding of the usage limits may lead to suspension or termination of your Lens ID.

4. PRIVACY

4.1. You agree to allow Mirantis and its affiliates to store and use information provided by you, including names, business phone numbers, and business e-mail addresses anywhere Mirantis does business that will be used only in connection with Mirantis’ business relationship with you, and may be transferred worldwide between Mirantis, its affiliates, subcontractors, partners, and assignees for uses consistent with Mirantis’ business relationship with you. Except for the foregoing and except for Lens Cloud Services as further stipulated in the Additional Terms, your use of, and Mirantis providing the Services does not require you to provide, disclose or give access to Mirantis any personal information (e.g. Personally Identifiable Information) or similarly protected sensitive data or personal data to Mirantis. You agree to take all reasonable steps to avoid disclosure of personal data to Mirantis; and that you are liable for all your personal data related obligations, including without limitation, confidentiality and data protection and privacy obligations and restrictions, imposed by applicable law, regulation or court order. If disclosed, you warrant that you have obtained all the relevant consents to disclose personal data to Mirantis, and you will defend, indemnify and hold Mirantis harmless from and against any claims arising out of your breach of this Section 4.1.

4.2. The Lens Software may automatically communicate with Mirantis servers to perform automated software updates and usage tracking. These features are designed to help provide a great end user experience.

    Automated Lens Software Updates. The Lens Software may automatically communicate with Mirantis servers to determine whether there are updated version(s) of the Lens Software available. You agree that the Software may be updated automatically on your computer without providing any further notice or receiving any additional consent. You may manually opt- out from automated Software updates.

    Telemetry Usage Tracking. In the default mode, the Lens Software automatically communicates with Mirantis servers to send certain telemetry data about the usage. This data is collected only for Mirantis legitimate interest and for the purpose of making the Software better. The telemetry data contain information about user interface events and generic information about the attached clusters. For avoidance of doubt, no sensitive data is sent, but some of the data can be qualified as data identifying an individual under various jurisdictions and you may manually opt-out from sending telemetry data.

    4.3. Mirantis will send occasional promotional emails about features, updates, events, and relevant announcements. By providing your email, you agree to receive these communications. You can opt out when you create your Lens ID or by clicking the &#34;Unsubscribe&#34; link in our emails. Please note that you may still receive important non-promotional communications.
