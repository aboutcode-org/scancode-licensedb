  "text": "****** SKIP - The System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns ******\n \n***** Introduction *****\n \nThe System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns (SKIP) system for\n ordering kanji was developed by Jack Halpern and used as the\n main index for kanji in the New Japanese-English Character\n Dictionary (Kenkyusha/NTC, 1990) and The Kodansha Kanji\n Learner's Dictionary (Kodansha, 1999) and other dictionaries\n published by Kanji Dictionary Publishing Society.\n \nThe SKIP codes for the kanji not in the NJECD were compiled by\n Jack Halpern and Martin Duerst (the remaining kanji in JIS X\n 0208) and Jim Breen (the 5,801 kanji in JIS X 0212).\n An overview of the SKIP system is available at this page.\n\n ***** Conditions Of Use *****\n\n As of December 12, 2014, the SKIP coding system and all\n established SKIP codes have been placed under a Creative\n Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_4.0_International.
