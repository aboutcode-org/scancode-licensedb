1. DEFINITION

   a) "Syncro" means Syncro Soft SRL.
   b) "Software" means the executable code of oXygen XMLDeveloper (software program for editing and processing XML documents), any updates or error corrections provided by Syncro and on-line or electronic documentation.
   c) "Named User" is an individual authorized by You to use the Software through the assignment of a single user ID, regardless of whether or not the individual is using the Software at any given time. 
   d) "License Key" means a unique key-code issued to You by Syncro (or its authorized reseller) to activate and use the Software.
   e) "Maintenance Pack" is a time-limited right to technical support and Software updates and upgrades which you may elect to purchase in addition to your Software license. Technical support only covers issues or questions resulting directly out of the operation of the Software. Syncro will not provide You with generic consultation, assistance, or advice under any other circumstances.

2. LICENSE GRANTS

 2.1. Trial Period License. You may download and use the Software for free for thirty (30) days after installation ("Trial Period"). During the Trial Period, Syncro grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-renewable license to copy and use the Software for evaluation purposes only and not for any commercial use. At Syncro discretion, Syncro may provide limited support through email or discussion forums at Syncro web site. The evaluation copy of the Software contains a feature that will automatically disable the Software at the end of Trial Period. Syncro will have no liability to you if this feature disables the Software.
 2.2. License After Trial Period. This Software is licensed, not sold. During Trial Period, You have the option of paying a license fee in order to use the Software after expiration of the Trial Period. The Software is available as Enterprise , Professional , Personal or Academic Edition and can be licensed either on a subscription or perpetual basis. Upon your payment of the license fee and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Syncro or its authorized reseller provides you with a License Key and grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: 
      a) use the Software on a Named User basis meaning specific individuals are authorized to access the Software and the total number of named users may not exceed the total number licensed by You.
      b) copy the Software in machine-readable form solely for backup purposes. If you do not pay the license fee before the Trial Period expires, the present License will be immediately terminated and you lose any right to the Software.
 2.3. The Named User of the Software may install and use the Software on as many computers (including operating systems) as he or she likes.
 2.4. Personal Edition Software. If you have acquired a Personal Edition, You are permitted to use the Software only if You are a natural person and You purchase the license using your own funds only. If any third party pays the license fee or if You expect or receive reimbursement for the license fee from any third party, this license shall be invalid and not in effect. For the avoidance of any doubt, Personal licences are not available to companies or business entities and can't be refunded by employers.
 2.5.  Floating License: If you are using the Software under the control of a Floating license, you may: 
      a) install the Software on an unlimited number of computers that are connected to the designated network (there has to be a TCP/IP connection between the machines)
      b) use the Software by no more than the authorized number of concurrent users. A separate license is required for each additional concurrent user and/or network on which the Software is used. Syncro will provide you with a license code key that enables the Software for a Floating license up to the authorized number of concurrent users. If a part of the Software (by means of the SDK) is integrated in a third party application that features a floating license mechanism compliant with the current Section, you may elect to use each instance of this application as an authorized concurrent user that shall be subtracted from the authorized number of concurrent users.
 2.6. Subscription. If You licensed the Software on a subscription basis, your rights to use the Software are limited to the subscription period that shall be indicated in your accepted order. In order to use the subscription you must register the activation code provided to you at the time of purchase and receive a License Key. Your license subscription will start on the date you receive the License Key, not from the date of purchase. After the expiration of your subscription, You are legally obligated to discontinue your use of Software and remove the Software from your system.
 2.7. Pre-release license. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Software is designated as pre-release or beta software, then you may use the Software in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement solely for evaluation purposes only for the term of the pre-release time period, which is specified elsewhere in the Software, or upon the commercial release of the Software. Syncro may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. You acknowledge that all Software designated as pre-release or beta Software may contain bugs, may not operate properly or perform all intended functions, may interfere with the functioning of other software applications, and may cause errors, data loss or other problems. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 2.8. Not For Resale license. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Software is designated as "Not For Resale", then you may use the Software only if you are a current Syncro Authorized Partner and then only for demonstration, test, training or evaluation purposes in support of your customers and you may not resell, or otherwise transfer for value, the Software.
 2.9. Upgrades. Notwithstanding any other terms in this Agreement, if the Software is licensed as an upgrade or update, then the latest update or upgrade that you download and install replaces the Software previously licensed. You agree that the upgrade or update and the associated license keys does not constitute the granting of a second license to the Software (i.e., you may not use the upgrade or update in addition to the Software it is replacing and whose license has terminated). 
 2.10. Prior Versions. Prior versions of the Software may be installed on the same computer with a properly licensed current version of Software. A Prior version may be used by a properly licensed user in place of the current version of the software. The prior version is not an additional license of the Software, it may be used only as a substitute for the current version.
