  \ PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE\n(\"AGREEMENT\"\
  ). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE\
  \ OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  in the case of The Open\
  \ Group, L.L.C. (\"The Open Group\"), the Original Program, and \n  in the case of each Contributor,\n\
  \                                                              \ni.     †changes to the Program,\

  \ Program;\n\nwhere such changes\nand/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed\
  \ by that\nparticular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it\n\
  was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\nContributor's\
  \ behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\nwhich:\n                \
  \                     \ni.     are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction\n\
  with the Program under their own license agreement, even if the separate\nmodules are linked\
  \ in binary form to the Program, and \n                                  \nii.     are not\
  \ derivative works of the Program.\n\n \"Contributor\" means The Open Group and any other\
  \ entity that distributes the Program.\n\n \"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable\
  \ by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\
  \ alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n \"Open Source\" programs mean software for\
  \ which the source code is\navailable without confidential or trade secret restrictions and\
  \ for which the\nsource code and object code are available for distribution without license\n\
  charges.\n\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying\n\
  this Agreement as released by The Open Group, including source code, object\ncode and documentation,\
  \ if any.\n\n \"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n \"Recipient\"\
  \ means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\
  \nGRANT OF RIGHTS\n\nThe rights\ngranted under this license are limited solely to distribution\
  \ and sublicensing\nof the Contribution(s) on, with, or for operating systems which are themselves\n\
  Open Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing\ndistribution and sublicensing\
  \ of the Original Program on, with, or for\noperating systems which are not Open Source programs.\n\
  \n  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the\n      limitations of this Section 2, each\
  \ Contributor hereby grants Recipient a\n      non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\
  \ license to reproduce,\n      prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n\
  \      distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,\n      and\
  \ such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n \n  †Subject to\n      the\
  \ terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each\n      Contributor hereby\
  \ grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n      royalty-free patent license under Licensed\
  \ Patents to make, use, sell,\n      offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution\
  \ of such\n      Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent\n \
  \     license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n      Program if,\
  \ at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,\n      such addition of the Contribution\
  \ causes such combination to be covered\n      by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\
  \ shall not apply to any other\n      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware\
  \ per se is\n      licensed hereunder.\n \n  Recipient understands that although each\n  \
  \    Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no\n      assurances\
  \ are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not\n      infringe the patent or\
  \ other intellectual property rights of any other\n      entity. Each Contributor disclaims\
  \ any liability to Recipient for claims\n      brought by any other entity based on infringement\
  \ of intellectual\n      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights\
  \ and\n      licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n      responsibility\
  \ to secure any other intellectual property rights needed,\n      if any. For example, if\
  \ a third party patent license is required to allow\n      Recipient to distribute the Program,\
  \ it is Recipient's responsibility to\n      acquire that license before distributing the\
  \ Program.\n \n  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge\n      it has sufficient\
  \ copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n      the copyright license set\
  \ forth in this Agreement. \n \n REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the\
  \ Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\na.      it\n\
  complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\nb.     its license agreement:\n\
  \                                                       \ni.     effectively disclaims on\
  \ behalf of all Contributors all\nwarranties and conditions, express and implied, including\
  \ warranties or\nconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions\n\
  of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n                               \
  \                     \nii.     effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\nliability\
  \ for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\nconsequential damages,\
  \ such as lost profits;\n                                                  \niii.     states\
  \ that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\nare offered by that Contributor alone\
  \ and not by any other party; and\n                                                 \niv.\
  \     states that source code for the Program is available from such\nContributor, and informs\
  \ licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on\nor through a medium customarily used\
  \ for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\na.\
  \      it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\nb.     a copy of this Agreement\
  \ must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must include the following\
  \ in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\nCopyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd.\
  \ and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn addition,\neach Contributor must identify itself\
  \ as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\
  \ Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\nCOMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
  \nCommercial\ndistributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to\n\
  end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to\nfacilitate the\
  \ commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations\nprovided in Section 2, the Contributor\
  \ who includes the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering should do so in a manner which\
  \ does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor\
  \ includes the\nProgram in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial\n\
  Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\nContributor (\"Indemnified\
  \ Contributor\") against any losses, damages\nand costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\
  \ from claims, lawsuits and\nother legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n\
  Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\nContributor\
  \ in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering. The\
  \ obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or\nLosses relating to any actual\
  \ or alleged intellectual property infringement. In\norder to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor\
  \ must:\n\na.      promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n\
  \nb.     allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial\n\
  Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations.\n\nThe Indemnified Contributor\
  \ may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a\nContributor might\
  \ include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product\nX. That Contributor is then\
  \ a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial\nContributor then makes performance claims,\
  \ or offers warranties related to\nProduct X, those performance claims and warranties are\
  \ such Commercial\nContributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial\n\
  Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related\nto those performance\
  \ claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages\
  \ as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT\
  \ AS\nEXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS\nIS\" BASIS,\
  \ WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT\
  \ LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR\
  \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining\
  \ the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated\
  \ with its exercise\nof rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks\
  \ and\ncosts of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of\ndata,\
  \ programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n DISCLAIMER\
  \ OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS\nEXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\
  \ ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n\
  EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER\
  \ CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\
  \ NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY\nWAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\
  \ OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\
  \ SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n GENERAL\n\nIf any provision\nof this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable\
  \ under applicable law, it shall\nnot affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder\
  \ of the terms of this\nAgreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\
  \ provision\nshall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid\n\
  and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient\ninstitutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings\
  \ to enforce\npatent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to\n\
  software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any\npatent licenses\
  \ granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this\nAgreement shall terminate as of\
  \ the date such litigation is filed. In addition,\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation\
  \ against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\
  \ the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n\
  infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section\
  \ 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's\nrights\
  \ under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of\nthe material terms\
  \ or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such\nfailure in a reasonable period of\
  \ time after becoming aware of such\nnon-compliance. If all Recipient's rights under this\
  \ Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon\
  \ as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any\
  \ licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\n\nThe\
  \ Open Group\nmay publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n\
  time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version\nnumber. The\
  \ Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject\nto the version of the\
  \ Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after\na new version of the Agreement\
  \ is published, Contributor may elect to\ndistribute the Program (including its Contributions)\
  \ under the new version. No\none other than The Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement.\
  \ Except as\nexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights\n\
  or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this\nAgreement, whether\
  \ expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights\nin the Program not expressly\
  \ granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nNo party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal\
  \ action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party\
  \ waives its rights to a jury trial\nin any resulting litigation."
