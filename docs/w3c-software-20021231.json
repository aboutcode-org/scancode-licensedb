  "text": "W3C Software Notice and License\n\nStatus: This license was applied to software published by W3C before 13 May,\n2015. On 13 May, 2015, W3C adopted a revised and renamed \"software and document\"\nlicense and applied the new license to all W3C documents that had previously\nbeen made available under this license. The new license grants all permissions\nthat had been granted under this 2002 license.\n\nThis work (and included software, documentation such as READMEs, or other\nrelated items) is being provided by the copyright holders under the following\nlicense. \n\nLicense\n\nBy obtaining, using and/or copying this work, you (the licensee) agree that you\nhave read, understood, and will comply with the following terms and conditions.\n\nPermission to copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation,\nwith or without modification, for any purpose and without fee or royalty is\nhereby granted, provided that you include the following on ALL copies of the\nsoftware and documentation or portions thereof, including modifications:\n\n    The full text of this NOTICE in a location viewable to users of the\n    redistributed or derivative work.\n\n    Any pre-existing intellectual property disclaimers, notices, or terms and\n    conditions.

Otherwise, this version is\nthe same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free\nSoftware Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification\nunder the Open Source Definition."
