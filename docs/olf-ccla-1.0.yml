text: "Open Logistics Foundation\nCorporate Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) \nVersion\
  \ 1.0, March 2022 \nhttps://www.openlogisticsfoundation.org/licenses\n\nThe Open Logistics\
  \ Foundation provides a framework for the design, development and use of open source solutions\
  \ in logistics. Within this framework, developers bring together their efforts for increased\
  \ efficiency and successful commercial use on the basis of open source components.\n\nThis\
  \ CLA enables the Contributor to submit Contributions to the Open Logistics Foundation, or\
  \ to have them submitted, and to grant the rights stated below in such Contribution/s in their\
  \ entirety. This CLA determines which of the Contributor’s rights in their Contributions to\
  \ the Open Logistics Foundation will be granted by the Contributor to the Open Logistics Foundation\
  \ and the conditions that must be observed in that regard.\n\nBy way of conclusion of this\
  \ CLA, the Contributor accepts the following conditions for their current and future Contributions\
  \ to the Open Logistics Foundation. Except for the licenses granted in this CLA to the Open\
  \ Logistics Foundation and the recipients of Works containing such Contribution distributed\
  \ by the Open Logistics Foundation, the Contributor reserves all rights in their Contributions.\n\
  \nPlease complete, sign and send this Agreement to info@openlogisticsfoundation.org. The CLA\
  \ is concluded when the Open Logistics Foundation expressly confirms the conclusion of the\
  \ CLA or activates access to the Open Logistics Repository for the Contributor, thereby enabling\
  \ the Contributor to submit Contributions.\n\nCorporation name: \nCorporation address:\nPoint\
  \ of Contact / CLA-Manager:\nE-Mail:\nPhone:\n\nReferred to as “Contributor” or “you”\n\n\
  1 Definitions\n\n(1) “Contribution” means any work protected under copyright, design and/or\
  \ patent law, including any modifications of or additions to this work as well as adaptations\
  \ of the work, that are submitted by the Contributor as copyright holder or by parties legally\
  \ or contractually entitled to do so by copyright holders to the Open Logistics Foundation\
  \ for inclusion in works developed and distributed by the Open Logistics Foundation. Within\
  \ the meaning of this definition, “submit” means any form of electronic or written communication\
  \ which is intentionally submitted to the Open Logistics Foundation to discuss or improve\
  \ a current or future work or project undertaken by the Open Logistics Foundation, including\
  \ but not limited to communications sent via electronic mailing lists, source code control\
  \ systems and issue tracking systems; however, communications that the Contributor or any\
  \ employee specifically named by him/her have clearly marked as “no contribution”, or which\
  \ are otherwise identified as such in writing, are excluded.\n\n(2) “Work” means any work\
  \ protected under copyright, design and/or patent law containing a Contribution.\n\n(3) “Committers”\
  \ are persons named by the Open Logistics Foundation or by Contributors who have write access\
  \ to works or projects undertaken by the Open Logistics Foundation in the version control\
  \ system.\n\n(4) “Source Code” means the version of the code of the respective Contribution\
  \ – if the Contribution is a software – in the programming language.\n\n(5) “Object Code”\
  \ means the intermediate product of a compilation or translation process of the Source Code.\n\
  \n2 Granting of usage rights\nThe Contributor hereby grants the Open Logistics Foundation\
  \ and any third party who receives and/or uses a Work or the Contributions themselves – whether\
  \ adapted or not - for the duration of the existence of the copyrights pertaining to such\
  \ Contributions\n• the royalty-free and non-exclusive right,\n• sublicensable for commercial\
  \ and non-commercial purposes\n• worldwide and perpetual,\n• irrevocable and non-terminable,\n\
  to use the Contributions in their original form or in modified, translated, edited or transformed\
  \ form on their own or as a part of a Work in the following ways:\n• use them in any hardware\
  \ and software environment, - insofar as the Contribution is a software – in particular to\
  \ store or load them permanently or temporarily, to display them and run them, including to\
  \ the extent reproductions are necessary to that end,\n• modify, translate, edit or transform\
  \ them in another way,\n• store, reproduce, exhibit or publish them, distribute them in tangible\
  \ or intangible form, on any medium or in any other way, for commercial and non-commercial\
  \ purposes, in particular to communicate them privately or publicly, also through image, audio\
  \ and other information carriers, irrespective of whether by wire or wireless means,\n• use\
  \ them in databases, data networks and online services, including the right to make it available\
  \ in Source Code or Object Code to users of the aforementioned databases, networks and online\
  \ services for research and retrieval purposes,\n• allow third parties to use or operate them,\n\
  • use them not only for own purposes but also to provide services to third parties,\n• distribute\
  \ them.\n\nThe above right of use relates to the Contributions, in particular – insofar as\
  \ the Contribution is a software– their Source Code and Object Code in any and all forms.\
  \ The above usage rights include – where applicable – design rights.\n\n3 Granting of a patent\
  \ license\n\n(1) For any patents (including pending patent applications) owned and licensable\
  \ by the Contributor at the time of the submission of the Contribution, the Contributor hereby\
  \ grants the Open Logistics Foundation and any third party who receives and/or uses a Work\
  \ containing the Contributions or the Contributions themselves - adapted or not - a\n• perpetual,\n\
  • worldwide,\n• non-exclusive,\n• free of charge,\n• irrevocable\npatent license in all rights\
  \ deriving from the patent to\n• produce,\n• arrange to have produced,\n• use,\n• offer for\
  \ sale,\n• sell,\n• import and otherwise transfer\n\n the Work or the respective Contributions.\n\
  \nHowever, this patent license covers only those rights deriving from the patent of the respective\
  \ Contributor as are indispensable in order not to infringe that patent and only to the extent\
  \ that the use of the Contributor’s respective Contribution, whether in itself or as a combination\
  \ with other Contributions of the Contributor or any third parties together with the Work\
  \ for which these Contributions were submitted, would otherwise infringe that patent. For\
  \ avoidance of doubt, no patent licenses are granted for the use of a Work or the Contribution\
  \ which become necessary for lawful use because third party modifications are made to the\
  \ Work or the respective Contribution after the Contribution has been submitted by the Contributor.\n\
  \n(2) If any entity or person institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity\
  \ or person (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution,\
  \ or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,\
  \ then any patent licenses granted to that person or entity under this CLA for that Contribution\
  \ or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n(3) The Contributor\
  \ is entitled to decide in its own discretion to abandon respectively maintain any patent\
  \ for which he has granted a patent license in accordance with para. 1 of this Section 3.\n\
  \n4 Contributor’s binding representations\n\n(1) The Contributor hereby represents that\n\
  a. it is entitled to grant the usage rights and - to the extent applicable - patent licenses\
  \ for Contributions under this CLA, and\nb. by granting usage rights under Section 2 above\
  \ and patent licenses under Section 3 above, they are not infringing any rights granted by\
  \ the Contributor to third parties.\n\n(2) Furthermore, the Contributor hereby undertakes\
  \ to identify by name all employees and service providers who submit Contributions or otherwise\
  \ make them available to the Open Logistics Foundation in the Contributor’s name, and that\
  \ all employees and service providers they identify by name to the Open Logistics Foundation\
  \ are authorised to submit Contributions in the Contributor’s name; identifying the employees\
  \ in this regard shall be at least in text form (as per Sec. 126b German Civil Code). It is\
  \ the Contributor’s sole responsibility to notify the Open Logistics Foundation if changes\
  \ need to be made to the list of named employees authorised to make Contributions in the Contributor’s\
  \ name.\n\n(3) If the Contributor wishes to submit a third-party work, this must take place\
  \ separately from any Contribution, in which case the complete details of the source and all\
  \ licenses or other limitations (including but not limited to any associated patents, trademarks\
  \ and licensing agreements) which they are personally aware of must be provided. The corresponding\
  \ work must be clearly identified as a third-party work when it is submitted.\n\n5 Trademarks\n\
  The Contributor does not grant permission to use its trade names, trademarks, service marks\
  \ or product names.\n\n6 No restriction on other use by the Contributor\nThe Contributor is\
  \ expressly permitted to use and exploit the Contributions on a commercial or non– commercial\
  \ basis – individually, in part or as part of another work – in accordance with the rights\
  \ held by the Contributor, provided that such other use or exploitation does not conflict\
  \ with the rights granted under this CLA.\n\n7 Obligations of the Open Logistics Foundation\n\
  \n(1) The Open Logistics Foundation is not obliged to incorporate the Contributor’s Contributions\
  \ into any Work or to use them in any other way.\n\n(2) If a Work is distributed by the Open\
  \ Logistics Foundation by way of incorporation of the Contributor’s Contributions or if the\
  \ Contributions themselves are distributed, the Open Logistics Foundation is obliged - irrespective\
  \ of whether the Contributions have been modified by the Open Logistics Foundation or any\
  \ third party -\na. to retain and to oblige the recipients of the Work to retain all copyright,\
  \ patent, trade mark and name credit notices in the Contributions - in the form as distributed\
  \ - with the exception of those notices that do not pertain to any part of the distributed\
  \ Contributions;\nb. to grant the Contributor a license to the rights in the distributed Work\
  \ that contains the Contributor’s Contributions, corresponding to Sections 2 and 3 above.\n\
  \n8 Contributor’s assumption of the role of Committer\nIf the Open Logistics Foundation under\
  \ a separate agreement assigns the role of a Committer to the Contributor and the Contributor\
  \ accepts the role, the Contributor must comply with the guidelines, policies and codes of\
  \ conduct imposed as part of the assignment.\n\n9 Limitation of liability\nExcept in cases\
  \ of intent and gross negligence or causing personal injury, the Contributor, its legal representatives,\
  \ trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable towards the Open Logistics Foundation\
  \ for direct or indirect, material or immaterial losses of any kind arising from the use of\
  \ the Contributions; this includes but is not limited to loss of goodwill, interruption of\
  \ production, computer failures or errors, loss of data or economic losses, even if the Contributor\
  \ has been made aware of the possibility of such losses. Notwithstanding the above, the Contributor\
  \ shall only be liable under product liability law to the extent that the respective provisions\
  \ are applicable to the Contributions.\nExcept in case of intent or gross negligence the Contributor,\
  \ its legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable that any\
  \ of the Contributions is free from any claim of infringement of any patent or any other intellectual\
  \ property right owned by any third party, accurate, devoid of mistakes, complete and/or usable\
  \ for any purpose.\n\n10 Other provisions\n\n(1) This CLA is governed by German law, excluding\
  \ the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Exclusive place\
  \ of jurisdiction for all disputes between the parties regarding\n the interpretation of this\
  \ CLA is Dortmund. This CLA or any provision thereof may be amended or modified only with\
  \ the mutual consent of the contracting parties as set out in a written instrument. This requirement\
  \ of written form can only be deviated from in writing.\n\n(2) Any failure by the Open Logistics\
  \ Foundation or the Contributor to insist that the other Party adhere to a provision of this\
  \ CLA in a given situation does not affect the right of such Party to require adherence in\
  \ the same regard at a later date. Waiving compliance with a provision in one situation shall\
  \ not be deemed a waiver of compliance with that provision in the future or as a waiver of\
  \ the provision in its entirety.\n\n(3) If any provision of this CLA should prove to be invalid\
  \ and unenforceable, then the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.\
  \ In this case, that provision will be replaced, as far as possible, by an enforceable provision\
  \ that most closely reflects the meaning of the original provision.\n\nLocation: \nDate: \n\
