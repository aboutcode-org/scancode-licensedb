1- Preface

The aim of this license is to lay down the conditions enabling you to
use, modify and circulate the SOFTWARE. However, INRIA and ENPC remain
the authors of the SOFTWARE and so retain property rights and the use
of all ancillary rights.

and their documentation that have been developed by INRIA and ENPC.

SCILAB DERIVED SOFTWARE is defined as all or part of the SOFTWARE that
you have modified and/or translated and/or adapted.

SCILAB COMPOSITE SOFTWARE is defined as all or a part of the SOFTWARE
that you have interfaced with a software, an application package or a
toolbox of which you are owner or entitled beneficiary.
