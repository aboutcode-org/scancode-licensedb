5. Term and Termination.

The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and remains

action in derogation of Sun&#39;s and/or its licensors&#39; rights to Software. Sun

reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual
property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination,
you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in
writing to Sun. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of
the Agreement.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt,
the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects
in materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing,
Software is provided &#34;AS IS&#34;. Your exclusive remedy and Sun&#39;s entire
liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun&#39;s option to replace
Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow
limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you.
This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,
which vary from state to state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF

DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE
LEGALLY INVALID.

8. Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF
THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY
TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. In no event will Sun&#39;s liability to you, whether in contract,
tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you
Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if
the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not
allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the
terms above may not be applicable to you.

9. Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered
under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to
comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you
have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or
import as may be required after delivery to you.

10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a
U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
Government&#39;s rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only
as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201
through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with
48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

11. Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and
controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction
will apply.

12. Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission
would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

13. Integration.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its
subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over
any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during
the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding,
unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
