  \ shall then be to indemnify Licensee pursuant to Section 8.1 and (i) refund the Perpetual\

  \ after modifications have been provided by Esri for avoiding infringement or use after a\
  \ return is ordered by Esri under Section 8.2.\n \n8.4 THE FOREGOING STATES THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION\
  \ OF ESRI AND ITS AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGATION OF INFRINGEMENT\

  9.1 Future Updates. Use of Products licensed under this License Agreement is covered by the\
  \ terms and conditions contained herein. New or updated Products may require additional or\
  \ revised terms of use under the then-current Esri License Agreement. Esri will make new or\

  \ expressly acknowledges and agrees that Licensee shall not export, reexport, import, transfer,\
  \ release, or provide access to Products, Content, Licensee's Content, or Value-Added Applications\

  \ Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) any person or entity on the US Commerce Department's\
  \ Denied Persons List, Entity List, or Unverified List; or (iv) any person or entity or into\
  \ any country where such export, reexport, access, or import violates any US, local, or other\
  \ applicable import/export control laws or regulations including, but not limited to, the\
  \ terms of any import/export license or license exemption and any amendments and supplemental\
  \ additions to those import/export laws as they may occur from time to time.\n \n9.3 Taxes\
  \ and Fees, Shipping Charges. License fees quoted to Licensee are exclusive of any and all\
  \ applicable taxes or fees, including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, value-added\
  \ tax (VAT), customs, duties, or tariffs, and shipping and handling charges.\n \n9.4 No Implied\
  \ Waivers. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this License Agreement\
  \ shall not be deemed a waiver of the provisions or of the right of such party thereafter\
  \ to enforce that or any other provision.\n \n9.5 Severability. The parties agree that if\
  \ any provision of this License Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such\
  \ provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make the intent of the language\
  \ enforceable.\n \n9.6 Successor and Assigns. Licensee shall not assign, sublicense, or transfer\
  \ Licensee's rights or delegate Licensee's obligations under this License Agreement without\

  \ License Agreement under FAR Subparts 12.211/12.212 or DFARS Subpart 227.7202. Esri Data\
  \ and Online Services are licensed under the same DFARS Subpart 227.7202 policy as commercial\
  \ computer software for acquisitions made under DFARS. Products are subject to restrictions,\
  \ and this License Agreement strictly governs Licensee's use, modification, performance, reproduction,\
  \ release, display, or disclosure of Products. License provisions that are inconsistent with\
  \ federal law will not apply. A US government Licensee may transfer Software to any of its\
  \ facilities to which it transfers the computer(s) on which such Software is installed. If\
  \ any court, arbitrator, or board holds that Licensee has greater rights to any portion of\
  \ Products under applicable public procurement law, such rights shall extend only to the portions\
  \ affected.\n \n9.10 Governing Law, Arbitration\n \na.     Licensees in the United States\

  \ property and for US government agency use. Except as provided in Section 9.8, any dispute\
  \ arising out of or relating to this License Agreement or the breach thereof that cannot be\
  \ settled through negotiation shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the\
  \ American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the\
  \ award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. If\
  \ Licensee is a US government agency, this License Agreement is subject to the Contract Disputes\
  \ Act of 1978, as amended (41 USC 601–613), in lieu of the arbitration provisions of this\
  \ clause. This License Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on\
  \ Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.\n\
  b.     All Other Licensees. Except as provided in Section 9.8, any dispute arising out of\
  \ or relating to this License Agreement or the breach thereof that cannot be settled through\
  \ negotiation shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International\
  \ Chamber of Commerce by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with said rules. The language\
  \ of the arbitration shall be English. The place of the arbitration shall be at an agreed-upon\
  \ location. This License Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention\
  \ on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly\
  \ excluded. Either party shall, at the request of the other, make available documents or witnesses\
  \ relevant to the major aspects of the dispute.\n \n9.11 Maintenance. Maintenance for qualifying\
  \ Products consists of updates and other benefits, such as access to technical support, specified\

  \ Licensee provides to Esri.\n \n9.13 Patents. Licensee may not seek, and may not permit any\
  \ other user to seek, a patent or similar right worldwide that is based on or incorporates\
  \ any Esri technology or services. This express prohibition on patenting shall not apply to\

  \ Content solely for the purpose of enabling Licensee's use of Online Services. Without Licensee's\
  \ permission, Esri will not access, use, or disclose Licensee's Content except as reasonably\
  \ necessary to support Licensee's use of Online Services, respond to Licensee's requests for\
  \ customer support, or troubleshoot Licensee's account or for any other purpose authorized\
  \ by Licensee in writing. If Licensee accesses Online Services with an application provided\
  \ by a third party, Esri may disclose Licensee's Content to such third party as necessary\
  \ to enable interoperation between the application, Online Services, and Licensee's Content.\
  \ Esri may disclose Licensee's Content if required to do so by law or pursuant to the order\
  \ of a court or other government body, in which case Esri will reasonably attempt to limit\

  \ Content is suitable for use with Online Services and for maintaining regular offline backups\
  \ using the Online Services export and download capabilities.\n \n4.2 Removal of Licensee's\
  \ Content. Licensee will provide information and/or other materials related to Licensee's\
  \ Content as reasonably requested by Esri to verify Licensee's compliance with this License\
  \ Agreement. Esri may remove or delete any portions of Licensee's Content if there is reason\
  \ to believe that uploading it to, or using it with, Online Services violates this License\
  \ Agreement. If reasonable under these circumstances, Esri will notify Licensee before Licensee's\
  \ Content is removed. Esri will respond to any Digital Millennium Copyright Act take-down\
  \ notices in accordance with Esri's Copyright Policy, available at http://www.esri.com/legal/dmca_policy.\n\
  \ \n4.3 Sharing Licensee's Content. If Licensee elects to share Licensee's Content using Sharing\

  \ Termination. Upon termination of the License Agreement or any trial, evaluation, or subscription,\
  \ Esri will make Licensee's Content available to Licensee for download for a period of thirty\
  \ (30) days unless Licensee requests a shorter window of availability or Esri is legally prohibited\
  \ from doing so. Thereafter, Licensee's right to access or use Licensee's Content with Online\
  \ Services will end, and Esri will have no further obligations to store or return Licensee's\
  \ Content.\n \nARTICLE 5—LIMITS ON USE OF ONLINE SERVICES; SERVICE CREDITS\n \nEsri may establish\
  \ limits on the Online Services available to Licensee. These limits may be controlled through\
  \ Service Credits. Service Credits are used to measure the consumption of ArcGIS Online services\
  \ made available through Licensee's account. The maximum Service Credits provided with Licensee's\
  \ ArcGIS Online account will be addressed in the applicable Ordering Document. Esri will notify\
  \ Licensee's account administrator when Licensee's Service Credit consumption reaches approximately\
  \ seventy-five percent (75%) of the Service Credits allocated to Licensee through Licensee's\
  \ subscription. Esri will notify Licensee's account administrator if Licensee's Service Credit\
  \ consumption reaches or exceeds one hundred percent (100%). If Licensee's account exceeds\
  \ one hundred percent (100%) of the available Service Credits, Licensee may continue to access\
  \ its account; however, Licensee's access to services that consume Service Credits will be\
  \ suspended. Licensee's access to the services that consume Service Credits will be restored\
  \ immediately upon the completion of Licensee's purchase of additional Service Credits.\n\
