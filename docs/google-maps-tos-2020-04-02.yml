text: "Google Maps Platform Terms of Service\n\nLast modified: April 2, 2020\n\nIf your billing\
  \ address is in Brazil, please review these Terms of Service, which apply to your use of Google\
  \ Maps Platform.\n\nSe a sua conta para faturamento é no Brasil, por gentileza veja o Termos\
  \ de Serviço, que será o Termo aplicável à sua utilização da Google Maps Platform.\n\nIf your\
  \ billing address is in Indonesia, please review these Terms of Service, which apply to your\
  \ use of Google Maps Platform.\n\nGoogle Maps Platform License Agreement\n\nThis Google Maps\
  \ Platform License Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made and entered into between Google (as\
  \ defined in Section 21 (Definitions)) and the entity or person agreeing to these terms (\"\
  Customer\").\n\nThis Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement,\
  \ or enters into a Reseller Agreement if purchasing through a Reseller (the \"Effective Date\"\
  ). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have\
  \ full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (b) you have read and understand\
  \ this Agreement; and (c) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not\
  \ have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to accept. This Agreement\
  \ governs Customer's access to and use of the Services.\n1. Provision of the Services.\n\n\
  1.1 Use of the Services in Customer Applications.  Google will provide the Services to Customer\
  \ in accordance with the Agreement, and Customer may use the Services in Customer Application(s)\
  \ in accordance with Section 3 (License).\n\n1.2 Admin Console; Projects; API Keys. Customer\
  \ will administer the Services through the online Admin Console. To access the Services, Customer\
  \ must create Project(s) and use its API key(s) in accordance with the Documentation.\n\n\
  1.3 Accounts. Customer must have an Account. Customer is responsible for: (a) the information\
  \ it provides in connection with the Account; (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security\
  \ of the Account and associated passwords; and (c) any use of its Account.\n\n1.4 Customer\
  \ Domains and Applications. Customer must list in the Admin Console each authorized domain\
  \ and application that uses the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring that only authorized\
  \ domains and applications use the Services.\n\n1.5 New Features and Services. Google may:\
  \ (a) make new features or functionality available through the Services and (b) add new services\
  \ to the \"Services\" definition (by adding them at the URL stated under that definition).\
  \ Customer’s use of new features or functionality may be contingent on Customer’s agreement\
  \ to additional terms applicable to the new feature or functionality.\n\n1.6 Modifications.\n\
  \n1.6.1 To the Services. Subject to Section 9 (Deprecation Policy), Google may make changes\
  \ to the Services, which may include adding, updating, or discontinuing any Services or portion\
  \ or feature(s) of the Services. Google will notify Customer of any material change to the\
  \ Services.\n\n1.6.2. To the Agreement. Google may make changes to the Agreement, including\
  \ pricing and any linked documents. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to\
  \ the Agreement will become effective 30 days after notice is given, except (a) materially\
  \ adverse SLA changes will become effective 90 days after notice is given; and (b) changes\
  \ applicable to new Services or functionality, or required by a court order or applicable\
  \ law, will be effective immediately. Google will provide notice for materially adverse changes\
  \ to any SLAs by: (i) sending an email to the Notification Email Address; (ii) posting a notice\
  \ in the Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer\
  \ does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer should stop using the Services. Google\
  \ will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.\n2. Payment Terms.\n\n2.1\
  \ Free Quota. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold,\
  \ as applicable.\n\n2.2 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, Google\
  \ will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold\
  \ based on Customer’s use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period. For use\
  \ above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set\
  \ in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer\
  \ elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google\
  \ will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period.\
  \ If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as stated in\
  \ the invoice. Customer’s obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google's measurement\
  \ of Customer’s use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple\
  \ bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google.\
  \ If Customer has entered into the Agreement with GCL, Google may collect payments via Google\
  \ Payment Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with offices at Belgrave House,\
  \ 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9TQ, United Kingdom.\n\n2.3 Taxes.\n\n2.3.1 Customer\
  \ is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the Services without any\
  \ reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced\
  \ to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate\
  \ authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the\
  \ total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time\
  \ of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google,\
  \ Customer must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation\
  \ to support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services are subject\
  \ to local VAT and the Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from amounts\
  \ payable to Google, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure\
  \ will be increased (grossed up) by Customer for the respective amount of local VAT and the\
  \ grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from\
  \ the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer\
  \ and Customer will ensure that Google will receive payment for its services for the net amount\
  \ as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted\
  \ to applicable tax authority).\n\n2.3.2 If required under applicable law, Customer will provide\
  \ Google with applicable tax identification information that Google may require to ensure\
  \ its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions.\
  \ Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties\
  \ or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the Customer.\n\n2.4 Invoice Disputes & Refunds.\
  \ Any invoice disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If Google determines\
  \ that Fees were incorrectly invoiced, then Google will issue a credit equal to the agreed\
  \ amount. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees\
  \ unless claimed within 60 days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with\
  \ its credit card issuer). Nothing in the Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any\
  \ party.\n\n2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. If Customer’s payment is overdue, then Google\
  \ may (a) charge interest on overdue amounts at 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted\
  \ by law, if less) from the Payment Due Date until paid in full, and (b) Suspend the Services\
  \ or terminate the Agreement. Customer will reimburse Google for all reasonable expenses (including\
  \ attorneys’ fees) incurred by Google in collecting overdue payments except where such payments\
  \ are due to Google’s billing inaccuracies.\n\n2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required. Google\
  \ is not required to provide a purchase order number on Google’s invoice (or otherwise).\n\
  3. License.\n\n3.1 License Grant. Subject to the Agreement's terms, during the Term, Google\
  \ grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to use\
  \ the Services in Customer Application(s).\n\n3.2 License Requirements and Restrictions. The\
  \ following are conditions of the license granted in Section 3.1 (License Grant). In this\
  \ Section 3.2 (License Requirements and Restrictions), the phrase “Customer will not” means\
  \ “Customer will not, and will not permit a third party to”.\n\n3.2.1 General Restrictions.\
  \ Customer will not: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile,\
  \ translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code (except\
  \ to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b) sublicense,\
  \ transfer, or distribute any of the Services; (c) sell, resell, sublicense, transfer, or\
  \ distribute the Services; or (d) access or use the Services: (i) for High Risk Activities;\
  \ (ii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees; (iii) for materials or activities that\
  \ are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United\
  \ States Department of State; (iv) in a manner that breaches, or causes the breach of, Export\
  \ Control Laws; or (v) to transmit, store, or process health information subject to United\
  \ States HIPAA regulations.\n\n3.2.2 Requirements for Using the Services.\n\n(a) Terms of\
  \ Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n(i) The Customer Application’s terms of service will (A)\
  \ notify users that the Customer Application includes Google Maps features and content; and\
  \ (B) state that use of Google Maps features and content is subject to the then-current versions\
  \ of the: (1) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html;\
  \ and (2) Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\n(ii) If the\
  \ Customer Application allows users to include the Google Maps Core Services in Downstream\
  \ Products, then Customer will contractually require that all Downstream Products’ terms of\
  \ service satisfy the same notice and flow-down requirements that apply to the Customer Application\
  \ under Section 3.2.2 (a) (i) (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy).\n\n(iii) If users of\
  \ the Customer Application (and Downstream Products, if any) fail to comply with the applicable\
  \ terms of the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service, then Customer will take\
  \ appropriate enforcement action, including Suspending or terminating those users’ use of\
  \ Google Maps features and content in the Customer Application or Downstream Products.\n\n\
  (b) Attribution.  Customer will display all attribution that (i) Google provides through the\
  \ Services (including branding, logos, and copyright and trademark notices); or (ii) is specified\
  \ in the Maps Service Specific Terms. Customer will not modify, obscure, or delete such attribution.\n\
  \n(c) Review of Customer Applications. At Google’s request, Customer will submit Customer\
  \ Application(s) and Project(s) to Google for review to ensure compliance with the Agreement\
  \ (including the AUP).\n\n3.2.3 Restrictions Against Misusing the Services.\n\n(a)  No Scraping.\
  \ Customer will not export, extract, or otherwise scrape Google Maps Content for use outside\
  \ the Services. For example, Customer will not: (i) pre-fetch, index, store, reshare, or rehost\
  \ Google Maps Content outside the services; (ii) bulk download Google Maps tiles, Street View\
  \ images, geocodes, directions, distance matrix results, roads information, places information,\
  \ elevation values, and time zone details; (iii) copy and save business names, addresses,\
  \ or user reviews; or (iv) use Google Maps Content with text-to-speech services.\n\n(b) No\
  \ Caching. Customer will not cache Google Maps Content except as expressly permitted under\
  \ the Maps Service Specific Terms.\n\n(c) No Creating Content From Google Maps Content. Customer\
  \ will not create content based on Google Maps Content. For example, Customer will not: (i)\
  \ trace or digitize roadways, building outlines, utility posts, or electrical lines from the\
  \ Maps JavaScript API Satellite base map type; (ii) create 3D building models from 45° Imagery\
  \ from Maps JavaScript API; (iii) build terrain models based on elevation values from the\
  \ Elevation API; (iv) use latitude/longitude values from the Places API as an input for point-in-polygon\
  \ analysis; (v) construct an index of tree locations within a city from Street View imagery;\
  \ or (vi) convert text-based driving times into synthesized speech results.\n\n(d) No Re-Creating\
  \ Google Products or Features. Customer will not use the Services to create a product or service\
  \ with features that are substantially similar to or that re-create the features of another\
  \ Google product or service. Customer’s product or service must contain substantial, independent\
  \ value and features beyond the Google products or services. For example, Customer will not:\
  \ (i) re-distribute the Google Maps Core Services or pass them off as if they were Customer’s\
  \ services; (ii) create a substitute of the Google Maps Core Services, Google Maps, or Google\
  \ Maps mobile apps, or their features; (iii) use the Google Maps Core Services in a listings\
  \ or directory service or to create or augment an advertising product; (iv) combine data from\
  \ the Directions API, Geolocation API, and Maps SDK for Android to create real-time navigation\
  \ functionality substantially similar to the functionality provided by the Google Maps for\
  \ Android mobile app.\n\n(e) No Use With Non-Google Maps. To avoid quality issues and/or brand\
  \ confusion, Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services with or near a non-Google\
  \ Map in a Customer Application. For example, Customer will not (i) display or use Places\
  \ content on a non-Google map, (ii) display Street View imagery and non-Google maps on the\
  \ same screen, or (iii) link a Google Map to non-Google Maps content for a non-Google map.\n\
  \n(f) No Circumventing Fees. Customer will not circumvent the applicable Fees. For example,\
  \ Customer will not create multiple billing accounts or Projects to avoid incurring Fees,\
  \ prevent Google from accurately calculating Customer’s Service usage levels, abuse any free\
  \ Service quotas, or offer access to the Services under a “time-sharing” or “service bureau”\
  \ model.\n\n(g) No Use in Prohibited Territories. Customer will not distribute or market in\
  \ a Prohibited Territory any Customer Application(s) that use the Google Maps Core Services.\n\
  \n(h) No Use in Embedded Vehicle Systems. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services\
  \ in connection with any Customer Application or device embedded in a vehicle. For example,\
  \ Customer will not create a Customer Application that (i) is embedded in an in-dashboard\
  \ automotive infotainment system; and (ii) allows End Users to request driving directions\
  \ from the Directions API.\n\n(i)  No Use in Customer Application Directed To Children. Customer\
  \ will not use the Google Maps Core Services in a Customer Application that would be deemed\
  \ to be a “Web site or online service directed to children” under the Children’s Online Privacy\
  \ Protection Act (COPPA).\n\n(j) No Modifying Search Results Integrity. Customer will not\
  \ modify any of the Google Maps Core Service’s search results.\n\n3.2.4 Benchmarking. Customer\
  \ may not publicly disclose directly or through a third party the results of any comparative\
  \ or compatibility testing, benchmarking, or evaluation of the Services (each, a “Test”),\
  \ unless the disclosure includes all information necessary for Google or a third party to\
  \ replicate the Test. If Customer conducts, or directs a third party to conduct, a Test of\
  \ the Services and publicly discloses the results directly or through a third party, then\
  \ Google (or a Google directed third party) may conduct Tests of any publicly available cloud\
  \ products or services provided by Customer and publicly disclose the results of any such\
  \ Test (which disclosure will include all information necessary for Customer or a third party\
  \ to replicate the Test).\n4. Customer Obligations. \n\n4.1 Compliance. Customer will: (a)\
  \ ensure that Customer’s and its End Users’ use of the Services complies with the Agreement;\
  \ (b) prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to its Account(s) or the Services;\
  \ and (c) promptly notify Google of any unauthorized use of or access to its Account(s) or\
  \ the Services of which Customer becomes aware.\n\n4.2 Documentation. Google may provide Documentation\
  \ for Customer’s use of the Services. The Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution\
  \ or HTML restrictions) on how the Services may be used and Customer will comply with any\
  \ such restrictions specified.\n\n4.3 Copyright Policy. Google provides information to help\
  \ copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but Google cannot determine\
  \ whether something is being used legally without input from the copyright holders. Google\
  \ will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and may terminate repeat infringers\
  \ in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online service providers\
  \ under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer believes a person or entity\
  \ is infringing Customer’s or End Users’ copyrights and would like to notify Google, Customer\
  \ can find information about submitting notices, and Google's policy about responding to notices\
  \ at https://www.google.com/dmca.html.\n\n4.4 Data Use, Protection, and Privacy.\n\n4.4.1\
  \ Data Use and Retention. To provide the Services through the Customer Application(s), Google\
  \ collects and receives data from Customer and End Users (and End Users’ End Users, if any),\
  \ including search terms, IP addresses, and latitude/longitude coordinates. Customer acknowledges\
  \ and agrees that Google and its Affiliates may use and retain this data to provide and improve\
  \ Google products and services, subject to the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\
  \n4.4.2 European Data Protection Terms. Google and Customer agree to the Google Maps Controller-Controller\
  \ Data Protection Terms at https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/maps-controller-terms.\n\
  \n4.4.3 End User Requirements.\n\n(a) End User Privacy.  Customer’s use of the Services in\
  \ the Customer Application will comply with applicable privacy laws, including laws regarding\
  \ Services that store and access Cookies on End Users’ devices.   Customer will comply with\
  \ the then-current Consent Policy at https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html,\
  \ if applicable.\n\n(b) End User Personal Data. Through the normal functioning of the Google\
  \ Maps Core Services, End Users provide personally identifiable information and Personal Data\
  \ directly to Google, subject to the then-current Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\
  \ (a) However, Customer will not provide to Google (i) any End User’s personally identifiable\
  \ information; or (ii) any European End User’s Personal Data (where “European” means “European\
  \ Economic Area, Switzerland, or the UK”).\n\n(c) End User Location Privacy Requirements.\
  \ To safeguard End Users’ location privacy, Customer will ensure that the Customer Application(s):\
  \ (i) notify End Users in advance of (1) the type(s) of data that Customer intends to collect\
  \ from the End Users or the End Users’ devices, and (2) the combination and use of End User's\
  \ location with any other data provider's data; and (ii) will not obtain or cache any End\
  \ User's location except with the End User's express, prior, revocable consent.         \n\
  5. Suspension. \n\n5.1 For License Restrictions Breaches. Google may Suspend the Services\
  \ without prior notice if Customer breaches Section 3.2 (License Requirements and Restrictions).\n\
  \n5.2 For AUP Breaches or Emergency Security Issues. Google may also Suspend Services as described\
  \ in Subsections 5.2.1 (AUP Breaches) and 5.2.2 (Emergency Suspension). Any Suspension under\
  \ those Sections will be to the minimum extent and for the shortest duration required to:\
  \ (a) prevent or terminate the offending use, (b) prevent or resolve the Emergency Security\
  \ Issue, or (c) comply with applicable law.\n\n5.2.1 AUP Breaches. If Google becomes aware\
  \ that Customer’s or any End User’s use of the Services breaches the AUP, Google will give\
  \ Customer notice of such breach by requesting that Customer correct the breach. If Customer\
  \ fails to correct such breach within 24 hours, or if Google is otherwise required by applicable\
  \ law to take action, then Google may Suspend all or part of Customer’s use of the Services.\n\
  \n5.2.2 Emergency Suspension. Google may immediately Suspend Customer’s use of the Services\
  \ if (a) there is an Emergency Security Issue or (b) Google is required to Suspend such use\
  \ to comply with applicable law. At Customer’s request, unless prohibited by applicable law,\
  \ Google will notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.\n\
  \n5.3 For Alleged Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights Infringement. If the Customer Application\
  \ is alleged to infringe a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, Google may require\
  \ Customer to suspend all use of the Google Maps Core Services in the Customer Application\
  \ on 30 days’ written notice until such allegation is fully resolved. In any event, this Section\
  \ 5.3 (For Alleged Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights Infringement) does not reduce\
  \ Customer’s obligations under Section 15 (Indemnification).\n6. Intellectual Property Rights;\
  \ Feedback.\n\n6.1 Intellectual Property Rights. Except as expressly stated in the Agreement,\
  \ the Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other’s\
  \ content or any of the other’s intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns\
  \ all Intellectual Property Rights in the Customer Application, and Google owns all Intellectual\
  \ Property Rights in the Google Maps Core Services.\n\n6.2 Customer Feedback. If Customer\
  \ provides Google Feedback about the Services, then Google may use that information without\
  \ obligation to Customer, and Customer irrevocably assigns to Google all right, title, and\
  \ interest in that Feedback.\n7. Third Party Legal Notices and License Terms.\n\nCertain components\
  \ of the Services (including open source software) are subject to third-party copyright and\
  \ other Intellectual Property Rights, as specified in: (a) the Google Maps/Google Earth Legal\
  \ Notices at https://www.google.com/help/legalnotices_maps.html; and (b) separate, publicly-available\
  \ third-party license terms, which Google will provide to Customer on request.\n8. Technical\
  \ Support Services.\n\n8.1 By Google.  Google will provide Maps Technical Support Services\
  \ to Customer in accordance with the Maps Technical Support Services Guidelines.\n\n8.2 By\
  \ Customer.  Customer is responsible for technical support of its Customer Applications and\
  \ Projects.\n9. Deprecation Policy.  \n\n Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before\
  \ making a Significant Deprecation, unless Google reasonably determines that: (a) Google cannot\
  \ do so by law or by contract (including if there is a change in applicable law or contract)\
  \ or (b) continuing to provide the Services could create a security risk or substantial economic\
  \ or technical burden.\n10. Confidentiality.\n\n10.1 Confidentiality Obligations. Subject\
  \ to Section 10.2 (Required Disclosure), the recipient will use the other party’s Confidential\
  \ Information only to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under the Agreement.\
  \ The recipient will use reasonable care to protect against disclosure of the other party’s\
  \ Confidential Information to parties other than the recipient’s employees, Affiliates, agents,\
  \ or professional advisors (“Delegates”) who need to know it and are subject to confidentiality\
  \ obligations at least as protective as those in this Section 10.1 (Confidentiality Obligations).\n\
  \n10.2 Required Disclosure.\n\n10.2.1 Subject to Section 10.2.2, the recipient and its Affiliates\
  \ may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable\
  \ Legal Process, If the recipient and its Affiliates (as applicable) use commercially reasonable\
  \ efforts to: (a) promptly notify the other party of such disclosure before disclosing; and\
  \ (b) comply with the other party’s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the\
  \ disclosure.\n\n10.2.2 Sections 10.2.1(a) and (b) above will not apply if the recipient determines\
  \ that complying with (a) and (b) could: (i) result in a violation of Legal Process; (ii)\
  \ obstruct a governmental investigation; or (iii) lead to death or serious physical harm to\
  \ an individual.\n\n10.2.3 As between the parties, Customer is responsible for responding\
  \ to all third party requests concerning its use and Customer End Users’ use of the Services.\n\
  11. Term and Termination.\n\n11.1 Agreement Term. The Agreement is effective from the Effective\
  \ Date until it is terminated in accordance with its terms (the “Term”).\n\n11.2 Termination\
  \ for Breach. Either party may terminate the Agreement for breach if: (a) the other party\
  \ is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 30 days after\
  \ receipt of written notice; (b) the other party ceases its business operations; or (c) becomes\
  \ subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days.\
  \  Google may terminate Projects or access to Services, if Customer meets any of the conditions\
  \ in subsections (a) or (b).\n\n11.3 Termination for Inactivity. Google may terminate Projects\
  \ with 30 days' prior written notice if such Project (a) has not made any requests to the\
  \ Services from any Customer Applications for more than 180 days; or (b) has not incurred\
  \ any Fees for more than 180 days.\n\n11.4 Termination for Convenience. Customer may stop\
  \ using the Services at any time. Subject to any financial commitments expressly made by this\
  \ Agreement, Customer may terminate the Agreement for its convenience at any time with 30\
  \ days' prior written notice. Google may terminate the Agreement for its convenience at any\
  \ time without liability to Customer.\n\n11.5 Effects of Termination. \n\n11.5.1 If the Agreement\
  \ terminates, then: (a) the rights and access to the Services will terminate; (b) all Fees\
  \ owed by Customer to Google are immediately due upon receipt of the final electronic bill;\

  \ obtain written permission from Google through the process specified in the Trademark Guidelines.\
  \ Google may include Customer’s name or Brand Features in a list of Google customers, online\
  \ or in promotional materials. Google may also verbally reference Customer as a customer of\
  \ the Services. Neither party needs approval if it is repeating a public statement that is\
  \ substantially similar to a previously-approved public statement. Any use of a party’s Brand\
  \ Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding Intellectual Property Rights to\
  \ those Brand Features. A party may revoke the other party’s right to use its Brand Features\
