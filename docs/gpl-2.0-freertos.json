Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that details\nto the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself to provide the\nFreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have made) should the\nrecipient request it.\n\n2. The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.\n\n3. The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS and\ndo not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.\n\nClause 2\n\nFreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the\npublication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express\npermission of Real Time Engineers Ltd.
