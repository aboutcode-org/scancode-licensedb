Version 1.0, 23 October 2023

Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek

Section I: PREAMBLE 

Large generative models are being widely adopted and used, and have the potential to transform the way individuals conceive and benefit from AI or ML technologies. 

Notwithstanding the current and potential benefits that these artifacts can bring to society at large, there are also concerns about potential misuses of them, either due to their technical limitations or ethical considerations. 

In short, this license strives for both the open and responsible downstream use of the accompanying model. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from open source permissive licenses regarding the grant of IP rights. Referring to the downstream responsible use, we added use-based restrictions not permitting the use of the model in very specific scenarios, in order for the licensor to be able to enforce the license in case potential misuses of the Model may occur. At the same time, we strive to promote open and responsible research on generative models for content generation. 

Even though downstream derivative versions of the model could be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always have to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original license (this license). We believe in the intersection between open and responsible AI development; thus, this agreement aims to strike a balance between both in order to enable responsible open-science in the field of AI. 

This License governs the use of the model (and its derivatives) and is informed by the model card associated with the model. 

NOW THEREFORE, You and DeepSeek agree as follows: 

1. Definitions 
&#34;License&#34; means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document. 
&#34;Data&#34; means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.
&#34;Output&#34; means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom. 
&#34;Model&#34; means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material. 
&#34;Derivatives of the Model&#34; means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model. 
&#34;Complementary Material&#34; means the accompanying source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any. 
&#34;Distribution&#34; means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access. 
&#34;DeepSeek&#34; (or &#34;we&#34;) means Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Fundamental Technology Research Co., Ltd., Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Fundamental Technology Research Co., Ltd. and/or any of their affiliates.
&#34;You&#34; (or &#34;Your&#34;) means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator, etc. 
&#34;Third Parties&#34; means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with DeepSeek or You. 

Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 

Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III. 

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, DeepSeek hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model. 

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and where and as applicable, DeepSeek hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by DeepSeek that are necessarily infringed by its contribution(s). If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model and/or Complementary Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for the Model and/or works shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed. 


Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION

4. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions: 
a. Use-based restrictions as referenced in paragraph 5 MUST be included as an enforceable provision by You in any type of legal agreement (e.g. a license) governing the use and/or distribution of the Model or Derivatives of the Model, and You shall give notice to subsequent users You Distribute to, that the Model or Derivatives of the Model are subject to paragraph 5. This provision does not apply to the use of Complementary Material. 
b. You must give any Third Party recipients of the Model or Derivatives of the Model a copy of this License; 
c. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; 
d. You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Model, Derivatives of the Model. 
e. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions - respecting paragraph 4.a. – for use, reproduction, or Distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivatives of the Model as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and Distribution of the Model otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 

5. Use-based restrictions. The restrictions set forth in Attachment A are considered Use-based restrictions. Therefore You cannot use the Model and the Derivatives of the Model for the specified restricted uses. You may use the Model subject to this License, including only for lawful purposes and in accordance with the License. Use may include creating any content with, finetuning, updating, running, training, evaluating and/or reparametrizing the Model. You shall require all of Your users who use the Model or a Derivative of the Model to comply with the terms of this paragraph (paragraph 5). 

6. The Output You Generate. Except as set forth herein, DeepSeek claims no rights in the Output You generate using the Model. You are accountable for the Output you generate and its subsequent uses. No use of the output can contravene any provision as stated in the License.

Section IV: OTHER PROVISIONS 

7. Updates and Runtime Restrictions. To the maximum extent permitted by law, DeepSeek reserves the right to restrict (remotely or otherwise) usage of the Model in violation of this License. 

8. Trademarks and related. Nothing in this License permits You to make use of DeepSeek’ trademarks, trade names, logos or to otherwise suggest endorsement or misrepresent the relationship between the parties; and any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by DeepSeek.
