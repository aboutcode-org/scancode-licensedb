Confidentiality

What is confidential, stays confidential.

All information relating to these Terms and/or during negotiations before the execution of any binding document that we may share between us shall be treated as confidential (“Confidential Information”).

During the Service Term, and for at least one (1) year thereafter, we expressly agree (i) to maintain the strict confidentiality of such Confidential Information, and to refrain from disclosing such Confidential Information to any third party, except as authorized by the original disclosing party in writing; (ii) to use such Confidential Information only for the purposes of performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement; and (iii) to use at least a reasonable standard of care in protecting the Confidential Information.

These restrictions on the use or disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information (i) which has been independently developed by the receiving Party, as evidenced by its written records, (ii) which has been lawfully received free of restriction from another source having the right to furnish such Confidential Information; or (iii) after it has become generally available to the public without breach of this section by the receiving Party; or (iv) which at the time of disclosure was already known to the receiving Party, and free of restriction as evidenced by documentation in such Party&#39;s possession; or (v) which the disclosing Party confirms in writing is free of such restrictions; or, (vi) which is required to be disclosed in any legal proceeding, upon express request from a governmental or regulatory agency, and/or pursuant to a requirement of law (and only with respect to such disclosure).

Each of us may disclose Confidential Information only to our employees, agents or subcontractors who need it in order to exercise rights or perform obligations under the Agreement, and who are required to protect it against unauthorized disclosure or use in a manner no less protective than required under the Agreement.

Confidential Information is and shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the disclosing Party.

Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, we ask you to promptly destroy or return all Confidential Information, and we will do the same if you ask us to do so.
