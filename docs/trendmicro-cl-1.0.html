This license agreement (the “Agreement”) contains the terms and conditions
for use of the TrendMicro Llama-TrendCybertron-8B-Instruct large language
model (the “Model”) and related agent software (the “Software”) with which
these terms and conditions are provided. The Model is based on the Meta

License, Copyright Meta Platforms, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

“Licensee” means the entity entering into this Agreement.
“Licensed Materials” means, collectively, the Model and the Software.

By using or distributing any portion or element of the Licensed Materials, you
agree to be bound by this Agreement.

1. License Rights and Redistribution.
   a. Grant of Rights. Licensor hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      non-transferable and royalty-free limited license to use, reproduce, modify
      and distribute the Licensed Materials, but not in connection with any
      product or service that competes with the Licensed Materials or any product
      or service of Licensor. Products and services compete even when provided
      free of charge. If you market a product as a practical substitute for a
      product or service, it competes with that product or service.
   b. Redistribution and Use.
      i. If you distribute or make available to others the Licensed Materials, or
         offer a product or service that uses the Licensed Materials, you (x) must
         provide such others with copy of this Agreement; (y) must prominently
         display “Powered by Trend Micro’s TrendMicro Llama-TrendCybertron-8B-
         Instruct” on the user interface, splash screen, dashboard, or similar
         product documentation; and (z) hereby consent to Licensor listing your
         name and product on its adopter’s web page.
      ii. You must retain, in all copies of the Licensed Materials that you make or
          distribute, a copy of this Agreement, or the following statement: “These
          materials are made available under the Trend Micro Community License
          1.0 https://github.com/trendmicro/cloud-risk-assessment-agent/blob/main
          /Trend Micro Community License 1.0.pdf” If you modify the
          Licensed Materials, you must also indicate that you have done so.
      iii. Your use of the Licensed Materials must comply with applicable laws and
           regulations, and, for the benefit of Meta Platforms Inc. and its
           affiliates, and Licensor, comply with the terms of the Llama 3 Community
           License.
      iv. The Licensed Materials are intended for security purposes. However, you
          must not make any statement to any other party regarding the Licensed
          Materials, or any products or services you provide using the Licensed
          Materials, that would constitute a warranty by Licensor, or that would
          reasonably be considered a warranty by Licensor.

2. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND ANY OUTPUT
   THEREFROM ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
   OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
   BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
   FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING OR REDISTRIBUTING
   THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND ASSUME ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
   YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND ANY OUTPUT AND RESULTS.
   If this provision is unenforceable under applicable law, the licenses granted to
   you hereunder are void.

3. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE,
   PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT,
   FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR
   ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY OF THE
   FOREGOING. If this provision is unenforceable under applicable law, the
   licenses granted to you hereunder are void.

4. Intellectual Property.
   a. Licensor hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.
      No trademark licenses are granted under this Agreement, except to you as
      necessary to comply with Section 1.b.
   b. If you bring litigation or other claims against Licensor alleging that the
      Licensed Materials constitutes infringement of intellectual property rights,
      then any licenses granted to you under this Agreement shall terminate
      immediately.

5. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement will commence upon your
   first access to the Licensed Materials and will continue unless and until you
   violate its terms, at which point your rights hereunder will terminate
   automatically. Sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 will survive any termination of this
   Agreement.

6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed and
   construed under the laws of the State of California without regard to choice
   of law principles, and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International
   Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. The courts of California shall
   have exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of this Agreement.</code></pre>
