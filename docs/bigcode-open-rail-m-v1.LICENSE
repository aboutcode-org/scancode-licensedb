BigCode Open RAIL-M v1 License Agreement

Section I: Preamble

This OpenRAIL-M License Agreement was created under BigCode, an open and collaborative research project aimed at the responsible development and Use of Large Language Models (“LLMs”) for code generation. This license is generally applicable to any machine-learning Model.

This License Agreement strives for both the open and responsible Use of the accompanying Model. Openness here is understood as enabling users of the Model on a royalty free basis to Use it, modify it, and even share commercial versions of it. Use restrictions are included to prevent misuse of the Model.

This License Agreement governs the Use of the Model and Modifications of the Model. You and Licensor agree as follows:

For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Model, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as “Not a Contribution.”

b. “Contributor” means Licensor and any individual or entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Model.

c. “Data” means a collection of information extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License Agreement.

e. “Harm” includes but is not limited to physical, mental, psychological, financial and reputational damage, pain, or loss.

f. “License Agreement” means this document.

g. “Licensor” means the rights owners or entity authorized by the rights owners that are granting the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

h. “Model” means machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights and parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to a model architecture as embodied in source code. Source code is not licensed under this License Agreement.

i. “Modifications of the Model” means all changes to the Model or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or Output of the Model.

j. “Output” means the results of operating the Model.

k. “Share” means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Modifications of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means, including - but not limited to - API-based or web access.

l. “Third Parties” means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with Licensor or You.

m. “Use” includes - but is not limited to - generating any Output, fine tuning, updating, running, training, evaluating and/or reparametrizing the Model.
