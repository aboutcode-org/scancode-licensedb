  \ Modifications or\n        combinations.\n\n3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. \n\n3.1. Application\
  \ of License.\n\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n \
  \   governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n    Section 2.2.\
  \ The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n    distributed only under the terms of\
  \ this License or a future version\n    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You\
  \ must include a\n    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n    distribute.\
  \ You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n    version that alters or restricts\
  \ the applicable version of this\n    License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,\
  \ You may\n    include an additional document offering the additional rights\n    described\
  \ in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \n\n    Any Modification which You\
  \ create or to which You contribute must be\n    made available in Source Code form under\
  \ the terms of this License\n    via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone\
  \ to whom\n    you made an Executable version available and to the Initial\n    Developer;\
  \ and if made available via Electronic Distribution\n    Mechanism, must remain available\
  \ for at least twelve (12) months\n    after the date it initially became available, or at\
  \ least six (6)\n    months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n \
  \   has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n    ensuring that\
  \ the Source Code version remains available even if the\n    Electronic Distribution Mechanism\
  \ is maintained by a third party.\n    You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer\
  \ of the\n    Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is\n    provided.\
  \ Cygnus will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may\n    provide an Electronic Distribution\
  \ mechanism for the Modification to\n    be made available. You can contact Cygnus to make\
  \ the Modification\n    available and to notify the Initial Developer.\n    (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos)\n\
  \n3.3. Description of Modifications. \n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which you\
  \ contribute to contain a\n    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\
  \ Code\n    and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement\n    that the\
  \ Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from\n    Original Code provided by the\
  \ Initial Developer and including the\n    name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\
  \ Code, and (b) in any\n    notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which\n\
  \    You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property\
  \ Matters \n\n        (a) Third Party Claims. \n\n        If You have knowledge that a party\
  \ claims an intellectual\n        property right in particular functionality or code (or its\n\
  \        utilization under this License), you must include a text file\n        with the source\
  \ code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes\n        the claim and the party making\
  \ the claim in sufficient detail\n        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you\
  \ obtain such\n        knowledge after You make Your Modification available as\n        described\
  \ in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL\n        file in all copies You make\
  \ available thereafter and shall take\n        other steps (such as notifying appropriate\
  \ mailing lists or\n        newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n\
  \        the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n        \n        (b) Contributor\
  \ APIs. \n\n        If Your Modification is an application programming interface and\n   \
  \     You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to\n        implement that\
  \ API, you must also include this information in\n        the LEGAL file.\n\n3.5. Required\
  \ Notices. \n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source\
  \ Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source\n    Code, where You describe\
  \ recipients' rights relating to Covered\n    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s),\
  \ You may add your\n    name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to\n\
  \    put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n    structure, then you\
  \ must include such notice in a location (such as\n    a relevant directory file) where a\
  \ user would be likely to look for\n    such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge\
  \ a fee for,\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n \
  \   recipients of Covered Code.\n\n    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and\
  \ not on behalf of\n    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely\
  \ clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered\
  \ by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\
  \ for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result\
  \ of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable\
  \ Versions. \n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements\
  \ of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n    and if You include a notice\
  \ stating that the Source Code version of\n    the Covered Code is available under the terms\
  \ of this License,\n    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n\
  \    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\n    included in any notice\
  \ in an Executable version, related\n    documentation or collateral in which You describe\
  \ recipients' rights\n    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\n\
  \    version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may\n    contain terms\
  \ different from this License, provided that You are in\n    compliance with the terms of\
  \ this License and that the license for\n    the Executable version does not attempt to limit\
  \ or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n  \
  \  forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different\
  \ license You must make it absolutely clear that any\n    terms which differ from this License\
  \ are offered by You alone, not\n    by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby\
  \ agree to\n    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability\
  \ incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of any such terms\
  \ You offer.\n    \n    If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\n\
  \    must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\n    other materials\
  \ provided with the product.\n\n3.7. Larger Works. \n\n    You may create a Larger Work by\
  \ combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and\
  \ distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n\
  \    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. INABILITY\
  \ TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. \n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any\
  \ of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\n\
  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent\
  \ possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that\nprohibits you from adhering to the license;\
  \ and (c) describe the\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included\n\
  in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\ndistributions of\
  \ the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\nstatute or regulation, such description\
  \ must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand\
  \ it. You must\nsubmit this LEGAL file to Cygnus for review, and You will not be able\nuse\
  \ the covered code in any means until permission is granted from\nCygnus to allow for the\
  \ inability to comply due to statute or\nregulation.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. \n\
  \nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\nthe notice in\
  \ Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\nCygnus may include Covered Code in products without\
  \ such additional\nproducts becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license\n\
  such additional products on different terms from those contained in this\nLicense.\n\nCygnus\
  \ may license the Source Code of Cygnus's Branded Code without\nCygnus's Branded Code becoming\
  \ subject to the terms of this License, and\nmay license Cygnus's Branded Code on different\
  \ terms from those\ncontained in this License. Contact Cygnus for details of alternate\nlicensing\
  \ terms available.\n\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. \n\n     6.1. New Versions. \n\n     Cygnus\
  \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from\n     time to time. Each version\
  \ will be given a distinguishing version\n     number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\
  \ \n\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n     the License,\
  \ You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n     that version. You may also choose\
  \ to use such Covered Code under\n     the terms of any subsequent version of the License\
  \ published by\n     Cygnus. No one other than Cygnus has the right to modify the terms\n\
  \     applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and\n     subsequent Licenses.\n\
  \n     6.3. Derivative Works. \n\n     If you create or use a modified version of this License\
  \ (which you\n     may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n     Covered\
  \ Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your\n     license so that the phrases\
  \ \"ECOS\", \"eCos\", \"Cygnus\", \"CPL\" or any\n     confusingly similar phrase do not appear\
  \ anywhere in your license\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the\
  \ license\n     contains terms which differ from the eCos Public License and Cygnus\n    \
  \ Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\n     Original Code or Contributor\
  \ in the notice described in Exhibit A\n     shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications\
  \ of this\n     License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \n\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER\
  \ THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\
  \ INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\nMERCHANTABLE,\
  \ FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\
  \ PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS\nWITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN\
  \ ANY RESPECT, YOU\n(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\n\
  ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\nWARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\
  \ ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\nCOVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT\
  \ UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION. \n\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder\
  \ will terminate\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n\
  such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\nsublicenses to the Covered\

  \ PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER\nPERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\
  \ CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nOF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS\
  \ OF\nGOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL\nOTHER COMMERCIAL\
  \ DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
  \ DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\
  \ INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH\
  \ LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\nOR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\
  \ CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION\nAND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S.\
  \ GOVERNMENT END USERS. \n\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\
  \ in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\"\nand \"\
