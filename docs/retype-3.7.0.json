You shall indemnify Us and our\nresellers, or at Our option, defend Us and our resellers against any claim, suit or proceeding\nbrought against Us or our resellers (i) arising by reason of Your accepting any such support,\nwarranty, indemnity or additional liability; or (ii) arising out of the use, reproduction or\ndistribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is solely based on the inclusion\nof the Software therein. Further, You agree only to distribute the Software pursuant to an\nenforceable written agreement for Our benefit that includes all the limitations and restrictions of\nthis Agreement and is as protective of Us and Software as is this Agreement.

Upon\nany such transfer, the Assignee may appoint new Designated Users.\n\nYou acknowledge that this Agreement is complete and is the exclusive representation of our\nagreement. No oral or written information given by Us, Our resellers, or otherwise on Our behalf\nshall create a warranty or collateral contract, or in any way increase the scope of this Agreement\nin any way, and You may not rely on any such oral or written information. No term or condition\ncontained in any purchase order shall have any force or effect.\n\nThere are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights,\nsave for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Us and our licensors. In addition, no\nlicenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Software and/or Modifications, as\napplicable, with any other software or hardware not delivered by Us or Our resellers to You under\nthis Agreement. Your rights under this Agreement apply only to Software, Modifications, and/or\nApplications for which all Designated Users are duly licensed hereunder.\n\nIf any provision in this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, such provision shall be\ndeemed omitted; the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any\nremedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of\nliability and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.\n\nThis Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative\nof each party. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement may not be\ndeemed a waiver of that or any other provision of this Agreement.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the law of the Province of Alberta, Canada and all parties\nirrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta and further agree\nto commence any litigation which may arise hereunder in the courts located in the judicial district\nof Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\nIf the Software or any related documentation is licensed to the U.S. Government or any agency\nthereof, it will be considered to be \"commercial computer software\" or \"commercial computer\nsoftware documentation,\" as those terms are used in 48 CFR \u00a7 12.212 or 48 CFR \u00a7 227.7202, and is\nbeing licensed with only those rights as are granted to all other licensees as set forth in this\nAgreement."
