This is a legal agreement between You (Licensee, either a company or an individual), and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation if You are located in the United States or Lattice SG Pte. Ltd. if You are located in a country other than the United States. Lattice Semiconductor Corporation or Lattice SG Pte. Ltd. is the Provider (Licensor) of the Software.  If a component covered by this Agreement can be included in the output files generated by the Provider’s LatticeMico System or any other Provider source code generation tool, then Software refers to such output files that includes that component.  Otherwise, Software refers to the component on a standalone basis.  By proceeding with the installation, modification, use or distribution in whole or in part of Software that identifies itself as licensed under the Lattice Open Source License Agreement, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, You are not permitted to use, modify or distribute the Software.

“Derivative Work” means a version of the Software in source code form that contains modifications or additions to the original source code and includes all Software files used to implement Your design. Derivative Work does not include identifiable modules within Your design that are not derived from the Software and that can be reasonably considered independent and separate modules from the Software.

3. The Provider grants to You a personal, non-exclusive right to use object code created from the Software or a Derivative Work to physically implement the design in devices such as a programmable logic devices or application specific integrated circuits.  You may distribute these devices without accompanying them with a copy of this license or source code.

4. This Software is provided free of charge.  IN NO EVENT WILL THE PROVIDER OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER CHARACTERIZED AS EXPENSES, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY SORT, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5. THE PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR IN ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR COMMUNICATION WITH YOU, AND THE PROVIDER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. YOU ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULTS AND FOR THE PROPER INSTALLATION, USE, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK OF THE SOFTWARE PROVING DEFECTIVE OR FAILING TO PERFORM PROPERLY, AND IN SUCH EVENT, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST AND RISK OF ANY REPAIR, SERVICE, CORRECTION, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITIES OR DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOFTWARE. THE SOLE LIABILITIES AND REMEDIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOFTWARE ARE SET FORTH ABOVE. 

6. Export Control. You agree that neither the Software nor any Derivative Work will be exported, directly or indirectly, into any country or to any person or entity, in violation of laws or regulations of the United States or other applicable governments. This Agreement will be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Oregon, USA.

7. Default and Termination. This Agreement will continue indefinitely, until and unless terminated. You may terminate this Agreement by destroying all copies of the materials to which this Agreement applies.  The Agreement will terminate automatically if due to any event, including court judgment, You fail to perform any of Your obligations hereunder. In the event of termination, others that have received software from You under the terms of this Agreement may continue to use it provided they remain in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

8. Your use of this Software is governed by this Lattice Open Source License Agreement.  However, depending on your design, the output files generated by the LatticeMico System or by any other Provider source code generation tool may contain open source code provided by a third party.
