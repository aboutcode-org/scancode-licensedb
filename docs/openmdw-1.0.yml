  OpenMDW License Agreement, version 1.0 (OpenMDW-1.0)

  By exercising rights granted to you under this agreement, you accept and agree
  to its terms.

  As used in this agreement, "Model Materials" means the materials provided to
  you under this agreement, consisting of: (1) one or more machine learning
  models (including architecture and parameters); and (2) all related artifacts
  (including associated data, documentation and software) that are provided to
  you hereunder.

  Subject to your compliance with this agreement, permission is hereby granted,
  free of charge, to deal in the Model Materials without restriction, including
  under all copyright, patent, database, and trade secret rights included or
  embodied therein.

  If you distribute any portion of the Model Materials, you shall retain in your
  distribution (1) a copy of this agreement, and (2) all copyright notices and
  other notices of origin included in the Model Materials that are applicable to
  your distribution.

  If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against any
  person or entity asserting that the Model Materials directly or indirectly
  infringe any patent, then all rights and grants made to you hereunder are
  terminated, unless that lawsuit was in response to a corresponding lawsuit
  first brought against you.

  This agreement does not impose any restrictions or obligations with respect to
  any use, modification, or sharing of any outputs generated by using the Model
  Materials.

  THE MODEL MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, OR THE
  ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS OR ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, ALL
  TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

  YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR (1) CLEARING RIGHTS OF OTHER PERSONS THAT MAY
  APPLY TO THE MODEL MATERIALS OR ANY USE THEREOF, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
  ANY PERSON'S COPYRIGHTS OR OTHER RIGHTS INCLUDED OR EMBODIED IN THE MODEL
  MATERIALS; (2) OBTAINING ANY NECESSARY CONSENTS, PERMISSIONS OR OTHER RIGHTS
  REQUIRED FOR ANY USE OF THE MODEL MATERIALS; OR (3) PERFORMING ANY DUE
  DILIGENCE OR UNDERTAKING ANY OTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE MODEL MATERIALS OR
  ANYTHING INCORPORATED OR EMBODIED THEREIN.

  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROVIDERS OF THE MODEL MATERIALS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
  DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
  OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE MODEL MATERIALS, THE
  USE THEREOF OR OTHER DEALINGS THEREIN.
