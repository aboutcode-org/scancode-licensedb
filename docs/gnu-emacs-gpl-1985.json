  "text": "GNU EMACS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\nmercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended to give everyone the right to share GNU Emacs.  To make\nsure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make\nrestrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\nto surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of Emacs, that you receive source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that you can change Emacs or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of Emacs, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for GNU Emacs.  If Emacs is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know\nthat what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Richard Stallman and the Free Software Fundation,\nInc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be\nallowed to distribute or change GNU Emacs.\n\n\t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of GNU Emacs source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each file a valid copyright notice such\nas \"Copyright (C) 1985 Richard M. Stallman\", containing the year of\nlast change and name of copyright holder for the file in question;\nkeep intact the notices on all files that refer to this License\nAgreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the GNU Emacs program a copy of this License Agreement\nalong with the program.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of GNU Emacs source code or\nany portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under\nthe terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    who last changed such files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of GNU Emacs\n    or any part thereof, to be freely distributed\n    and licensed to all third parties on terms identical to those\n    contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose\n    to grant more extensive warranty protection to third parties,\n    at your option).\n\n    c) if the modified program serves as a text editor, cause it\n    when started running in the simplest and usual way, to print\n    an announcement including a valid copyright notice (\"Copyright\n    (C)\", the year of authorship, and all copyright owners' names),\n    saying that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of\n    this License Agreement.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute GNU Emacs or any portion of it in\ncompiled, executable or object code form under the terms of Paragraphs\n1 and 2 above provided that you do the following:\n\n    a) cause each such copy of GNU Emacs to be accompanied by the\n    corresponding machine-readable source code; or\n\n    b) cause each such copy of GNU Emacs to be accompanied by a\n    written offer, with no time limit, to give any third party\n    free (except for a nominal shipping charge) machine readable\n    copy of the corresponding source code; or\n\n    c) in the case of a recipient of GNU Emacs in compiled, executable\n    or object code form (without the corresponding source code) you\n    shall cause copies you distribute to be accompanied by a copy\n    of the written offer of source code which you received along\n    with the copy of GNU Emacs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs\nexcept as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs is void and\nyour rights to use GNU Emacs under this License agreement shall be\nautomatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\nsoftware programs from you with this License Agreement will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\nYour comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\nsoftware are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n1000 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138, or call (617) 876-3296.\n\n\t\t\t   NO WARRANTY\n\n  BECAUSE GNU EMACS IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY\nNO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC,\nRICHARD M. STALLMAN AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE GNU EMACS \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY\nAND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE GNU EMACS\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\nSERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL FREE SOFTWARE\nFOUNDATION, INC., RICHARD M. STALLMAN, AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\nMODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE GNU EMACS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH PROGRAMS NOT DISTRIBUTED BY\nFREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.) THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY\nOTHER PARTY."
