        to copy and/or modify the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum hereunder for its own research, development and the like.
        to run the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum hereunder for its own research, development and the like.
        to run the Source Code modified in accordance with the provision of Article 4.3 (1) above for its own research, development and the like.
        to distribute the Binary Code created from the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum hereunder or from the Source Code modified in accordance with the provision of Article 4.3 (1) above.
    In accordance with the license granted under Article 4.1 above, the System Developer may perform the following acts:
        to perform any and all acts set forth in the Article 4.3 above.
        to develop and manufacture the Embedded Product containing the Binary Code, and, whether with or without payment, provide the End User with the same and make the Binary Code available to the End User on the Embedded Product.
    The Source Code User and the System Developer shall be obligated to give a notice that the Source Code is used, in such a way as separately specified by T-Engine Forum, when they use the Source Code or the Binary Code, or make the Binary Code available for the End User on the Embedded Product.

Article 5. Distribution of Modified Source Code

    Any of A- members of T-Engine Forum may become the Distributor of Modification by obtaining the approval of T-Engine Forum through the registration procedure as prescribed by the Forum provided that only the department of the A- member which has taken the registration procedure may distribute the Modified Source Code in such a way as provided for in this Article as long as it holds the A- membership.
