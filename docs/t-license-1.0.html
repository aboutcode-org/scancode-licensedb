    As provided for in this Article, T-Engine Forum shall provide, and grant a license to use, the Source Code free of charge to any person who has taken the necessary procedure for registration as prescribed by T-Engine Forum and agreed to the T-License.
    The Source Code shall be distributed exclusively by T-Engine Forum. Any person who obtains the Source Code under Article 4.1 above shall not make any re-Distribution of the Source Code.
    In accordance with the license granted under Article 4.1 above, the Source Code User may perform the following acts:
        to copy and/or modify the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum hereunder for its own research, development and the like.
        to run the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum hereunder for its own research, development and the like.
        to run the Source Code modified in accordance with the provision of Article 4.3 (1) above for its own research, development and the like.
        to distribute the Binary Code created from the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum hereunder or from the Source Code modified in accordance with the provision of Article 4.3 (1) above.
    In accordance with the license granted under Article 4.1 above, the System Developer may perform the following acts:
        to perform any and all acts set forth in the Article 4.3 above.
        to develop and manufacture the Embedded Product containing the Binary Code, and, whether with or without payment, provide the End User with the same and make the Binary Code available to the End User on the Embedded Product.
    The Source Code User and the System Developer shall be obligated to give a notice that the Source Code is used, in such a way as separately specified by T-Engine Forum, when they use the Source Code or the Binary Code, or make the Binary Code available for the End User on the Embedded Product.

Article 5. Distribution of Modified Source Code

    Any of A- members of T-Engine Forum may become the Distributor of Modification by obtaining the approval of T-Engine Forum through the registration procedure as prescribed by the Forum provided that only the department of the A- member which has taken the registration procedure may distribute the Modified Source Code in such a way as provided for in this Article as long as it holds the A- membership.
    The Distributor of Modification may create the Modified Source Code based on the Source Code provided by T-Engine Forum and the Patch for Modification to be applied to create such Modified Source Code from the Source Code.
    The Distributor of Modification shall, prior to the distribution, inform T-Engine Forum of and register a name and description of the Modified Source Code in such a way as specified by T-Engine Forum.
    The Distributor of Modification shall determine the name of the Modified Source Code subject to the rules separately established by T-Engine Forum and publish an appropriate notice as required by the rules on the Patch for Modification and the Modified Source Code.
    The Distributor of Modification may distribute the Modified Source Code to a third party, whether with or without payment, provided that the Distributor of Modification shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the third party from making the re-Distribution of the Modified Source Code.
    The Distributor of Modification may provide the System Developer with the Patch for Modification. Provided, however, that the Distributor of Modification shall be obligated to confirm that the System Developer is the Source Code User duly licensed under Article 4.1.
    The Distributor of Modification may perform the Vicarious Execution of Patch Processing for the System Developer.
    The System Developer shall not distribute the Modified Source Code in further modified form to any third party as a stand-alone software product.

Article 6. Distribution and Registration of the Ported Source Code

    The Source Code User and the System Developer may, whether with or without charge, distribute to any third party only the following parts of the Ported Source Code on the T-Engine Hardware or the Similar Hardware to T-Engine Hardware:
        The Hardware-dependent Part and/or Compiler-dependent Part; provided that the Source Code User and the System Developer shall inform T-Engine Forum of, and T-Engine Forum may publish, a method for distributing said Part(s) to third parties.
        The Header File; provided that the Header File shall be distributed together with the Binary Code of the Ported Source Code.
