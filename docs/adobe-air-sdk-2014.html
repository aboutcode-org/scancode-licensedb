THE SDK IS PROVIDED TO YOU &#34;AS IS,&#34; AND ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU OF ANY KIND. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ADOBE MAKES NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY WITH REGARD TO PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK AND YOUR USE OF AND OUTPUT FROM THE SDK. Adobe is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to you for any portion of the SDK. The foregoing limitations, exclusions and limitations shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails its essential purpose.

1.2 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY OR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY OF CARE, OR CLAIMS BY A THIRD PARTY EVEN IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. ADOBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SDK, IF ANY.

You agree to hold Adobe harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, actions, damages or claims (including product liability, warranty and intellectual property claims, and all reasonable expenses, costs and attorneys fees) arising out of or relating to your distribution of all or any portion of the SDK or any Developer Application; provided that Adobe cooperates with you, at your expense, in resolving any such claim.

5. DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS AND PRIVACY.
5.1 Development. You shall not create or distribute any software, including any Developer Application that interoperates with individual Runtime Components in a manner not documented by Adobe. You shall not create or distribute any software, including any Developer Application that is designed to interoperate with an un-installed instance of the Runtime Software. You shall not create or distribute any Developer Application that runs without installation. You are not permitted to install or use the Build Tools or other portions of the SDK to develop software prohibited by this agreement. Failure to comply with this Section 5.1 is a breach of this agreement that immediately terminates all rights granted to you herein.

5.2 Other Prohibitions. You will not use the SDK to create, develop or use any program, software or service that (a) contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information, (b) when used in the manner in which it is intended or marketed, violates any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or rights (including any laws, regulations or rights respecting intellectual property, computer spyware, privacy, export control, unfair competition, antidiscrimination or advertising), or (c) interferes with the operability of Adobe or third-party programs or software.

5.4 MP3 Codec Use. You may not modify the runtime libraries or Build Tools. You may not access MP3 codecs within the runtime libraries other than through the published runtime APIs. Development, use or distribution of a Developer Application that operates on non-PC devices and that decodes MP3 data not contained within a SWF, FLV or other file format that contains more than MP3 data may require one or more third-party license(s).

5.5 Privacy. You will comply with all data protection and privacy laws and rules applicable to the personal information of your end users. You will conspicuously post a privacy policy that tells users what personal data you are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer that data. In addition, you will include your privacy policy URL conspicuously in the Developer Application, and you must also include a link to your app&#39;s privacy policy in any app marketplace that provides you with the functionality to do so. Adobe provides information about common privacy issues at www.adobe.com/go/air_developer_privacy.

6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
The SDK and any copies that you are authorized by Adobe to make are the intellectual property of and are owned by Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The structure, organization and code of the SDK provided to you in compiled or object code form are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The SDK is protected by copyright, including by United States Copyright Law, international treaty provisions and applicable laws in the country in which they are used. Except as expressly stated herein, this agreement does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the SDK and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by Adobe.

7. REVERSE ENGINEERING.

8. NON-BLOCKING OF ADOBE DEVELOPMENT.
You acknowledge that Adobe is currently developing or may develop technologies and products in the future that have or may have design and/or functionality similar to products that you may develop based on your license herein. Nothing in this agreement shall impair, limit or curtail Adobe’s right to continue with its development, maintenance and/or distribution of Adobe’s technology or products. You agree that you shall not assert in any way any patent owned by you arising out of or in connection with the SDK or modifications made thereto against Adobe, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or their customers, direct or indirect, agents and contractors for the manufacture, use, import, licensing, offer for sale or sale of any Adobe products.

9. PRE-RELEASE SDK ADDITIONAL TERMS.
If the SDK or any of its components are pre-commercial release or beta software (&#34;Pre-release Software&#34;), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre-release version, does not represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. If you received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for PreRelease Software, your use of the Software is also governed by such agreement. You will return or destroy all copies of Pre-release Software upon request by Adobe or upon Adobe’s commercial release of such Software. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

10. TERM AND TERMINATION.
This agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and continue in perpetuity unless terminated as set forth herein. Adobe may terminate this agreement immediately if you breach any of its terms. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 will survive any termination of this agreement. Upon termination of this agreement, you will cease all use and distribution of the SDK and return to Adobe or destroy (with written confirmation of destruction) the SDK promptly at Adobe’s request, together with any copies thereof.

11. EXPORT RULES.
You acknowledge that the SDK is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the &#34;EAR&#34;) and that you will comply with the EAR. You will not export or re-export the SDK, or any portion hereof, directly or indirectly, to: (a) any countries that are subject to US export restrictions (currently including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria); (b) any end user who you know or have reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or rocket systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle systems; or (c) any end user who has been prohibited from participating in the US export transactions by any federal agency of the US government. In addition, you are responsible for complying with any local laws in your jurisdiction which may impact your right to import, export or use the SDK.

12. NOTICE TO U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
