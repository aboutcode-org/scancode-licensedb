  \ If you have the need to\ncreate a derivative work you may contact the Odin\nmanagement team\

  \nThese license terms can be amended by a custom license\nagreement between a third party\
  \ and the administration\nteam. Such a custom license might only limit the above terms\nif\
  \ the changes cause a direct advantage for the functionality\nor completeness of the product\
  \ and do not interfere with the\ngoal of an open-source and free emulation product.\n\nParts\
  \ of the work may be governed by a license other than\nthis one, if the source directory of\
  \ the part contains a\nlicense file called \"LICENSE.TXT\" of its own. If a different\nlicense\
  \ exists, it supercedes this license. Removing the\nthe part specific license will automatically\
  \ put back the\npart under the terms of this license. Only the Odin management\nteam is allowed\
  \ to put parts of the work under a different\nlicense and remove the part specific licenses.\
  \ The purpose\nof using different licenses is solely for allowing code\nsharing of certain\
  \ parts of the work with other projects that\nhave incompatible licenses. These parts should\
  \ either have\nthis license in a version that makes it compatible with the\nlicense of the\
  \ second project, or the license of the second\nproject as long as it conforms to the goals\
  \ of an open source\nand free emulation software.\n\nWarranty\n\nEXCEPT AS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED\
