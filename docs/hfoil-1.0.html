patent infringement, then any rights granted to You under this License Agreement for the
Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

No other rights. All rights not expressly granted herein are retained.


2. RESTRICTIONS

You may not distribute the Software as a hosted or managed, and paid service, where the
service grants users access to any substantial set of the features or functionality of the
Software. If you wish to do so, You will need to be granted additional rights from the
Licensor which will be subject to a separate mutually agreed agreement.

You may not sublicense the Software under any other terms than those listed in this

4. MISCELLANEOUS

Termination. Licensor reserves the right to restrict Use of the Software in violation of
this License Agreement, upon which Your licenses will automatically terminate.

Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Software by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms
and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
Contributions.

Trademarks and related. Nothing in this License Agreement permits You (i) to make Use of
Licensors’ trademarks, trade names, or logos, (ii) otherwise suggest endorsement by
Licensor, or (iii) misrepresent the relationship between the parties; and any rights not
expressly granted herein are reserved by the Licensors.

Output You generate. Licensor claims no rights in the Output. You agree not to contravene
any provision as stated in the License Agreement with your Use of the Output.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, Licensor provides the Software (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) AS IS, and Licensor disclaims all warranties or guarantees of any kind,
express or implied, whether arising under any law or from any usage in trade, or otherwise
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement,
quiet enjoyment, fitness for a particular purpose, or otherwise. You are solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of the Software and Modifications of the
Software for your purposes (including your use or distribution of the Software and
Modifications of the Software), and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License Agreement.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to
You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of this License Agreement or out of the Use
or inability to Use the Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, model failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
of the possibility of such damages.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While sharing the Software or Modifications of
the Software thereof, You may choose to offer and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of Licensor or any other
Contributor, and you hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor and each other
Contributor (and their successors or assigns) harmless for any liability incurred by, or
claims asserted against, such Licensor or Contributor (and their successors or assigns) by
reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Severability. This License Agreement is a license of copyright and patent rights and an
agreement in contract between You and the Licensor. If any provision of this License
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
be unaffected thereby and remain valid as if such provision had not been set forth herein.
