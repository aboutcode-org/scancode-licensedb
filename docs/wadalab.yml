  You can use/modify/distribute this font as long as:

    1) add a note which explains that the distributed fonts
       are derived from wadalab fonts which is distributed
       at ftp.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp

    2) if the redistribution is the modified one from the original
       font archives, then provide some documentations which explain
       the changes/modifications from the original font archives.

  These conditions are to inform users about where they
  can get the most updated font from, because we plan
  to update it.

  If you find the badly designed glyphs, or wrong kanji
  characters, please contact at tanaka@ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp
