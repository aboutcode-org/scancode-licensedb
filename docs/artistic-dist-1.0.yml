text: "                      The \"Artistic License\"\n \n                             Preamble\n\
  \ \nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\nPackage may be copied,\
  \ such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\nsemblance of artistic control over the development\
  \ of the Package,\nwhile giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\n\
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\nreasonable modifications.\n\
  \ \nIt also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own\nprograms without\
  \ transferring this License to those programs, provided\nthat you meet some reasonable requirements.\n\
  \ \nDefinitions:\n \n        \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by\
  \ the\n        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\n        created\
  \ through textual modification.\n \n        \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package\
  \ if it has not been\n        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\n\
  \        of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n \n        \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever\
  \ is named in the copyright or\n        copyrights for the package.\n \n        \"You\" is\
  \ you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\n        this Package.\n \n      \
  \  \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the\n        basis of media cost,\
  \ duplication charges, time of people involved,\n        and so on.  (You will not be required\
  \ to justify it to the\n        Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\n\
  \        as a market that must bear the fee.)\n \n        \"Freely Available\" means that\
  \ no fee is charged for the item\n        itself, though there may be fees involved in handling\
  \ the item.\n        It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\n     \
  \   under the same conditions they received it.\n \n1. You may make and give away verbatim\
  \ copies of the source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package without restriction,\
  \ provided that you\nduplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\
  \ \n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\nderived from the\
  \ Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\nmodified in such a way shall still\
  \ be considered the Standard Version.\n \n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package\
  \ in any way, provided\nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how\
  \ and\nwhen you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\nfollowing:\n\
  \ \n    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n    Freely\
  \ Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\n    an equivalent medium,\
  \ or placing the modifications on a major archive\n    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing\
  \ the Copyright Holder to include\n    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\
  \ \n    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n \n   \
  \ c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n    with standard executables,\
  \ which must also be provided, and provide\n    a separate manual page for each non-standard\
  \ executable that clearly\n    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n \n  \
  \  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n \n4. You may distribute\
  \ the programs of this Package in object code or\nexecutable form, provided that you do at\
  \ least ONE of the following:\n \n    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables\
  \ and library files,\n    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on\
  \ where\n    to get the Standard Version.\n \n    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable\
  \ source of\n    the Package with your modifications.\n \n    c) give non-standard executables\
  \ non-standard names, and clearly\n    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),\
  \ together\n    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n \n    d) make other\
  \ distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n \n5. You may charge a reasonable\
  \ copying fee for any distribution of this\nPackage.  You may charge any fee you choose for\
  \ support of this\nPackage.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\n\
  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\ncommercial) programs as\
  \ part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\ndistribution provided that you do not advertise\
  \ this Package as a\nproduct of your own.\n \n6. The scripts and library files supplied as\
  \ input to or produced as\noutput from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\n\
  under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\nthem, and may be sold\
  \ commercially, and may be aggregated with this\nPackage.  If such scripts or library files\
  \ are aggregated with this\nPackage via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of\
  \ producing a\nbinary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\nneither\
  \ be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\nfall under the restrictions\
  \ of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\nnot represent such an executable image as a\
  \ Standard Version of this\nPackage.\n \n7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own\
  \ programs, provided that\nyou explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code\
  \ (and, left\nto your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\ncopyright\
  \ notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\nclearly marked as such.\
  \ Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\nlicense if, and only if, the name\
  \ of your program(s) have no immediate\nconnection with the name of the Package itself or\
  \ its associated programs.\nYou may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused\
  \ parts or\nchoose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\ncontext\
  \ of your package.\n \n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\n\
  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n \n9. THIS\
  \ PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING,\
  \ WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
  \ PURPOSE.\n \n                                The End"
