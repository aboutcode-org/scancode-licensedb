(f) 	reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time and to any subordinate provision made under that legislation.

2. Basis of terms
2.1 	These Terms are framework terms further to which the parties may enter into a Licence Quote in respect of Services to be provided by the Licensor to the Licensee. The parties may also, from time to time after the Licence Quote enter into additional quotes (whether in online, electronic or printed form) in respect of:
(a) 	additional Licensee Developers, Production Environment(s) and/or to add on a Single Application Developer Licence, Multiple Applications Developer Licence and/or Deployment Licence Add-On in excess of the terms set out in the Licence Quote (together referred to as &#34;Additional Usage&#34;); or
(b) 	a renewed period of Support Services,
	(each an &#34;Additional Quote&#34;).
2.2 	Each such Licence Quote and Additional Quote (each a &#34;Quote&#34; and together referred to as a &#34;Quotes&#34;), once agreed in accordance with clause 2.3, shall constitute a separate contract for the provision of the Services specified in such Quote, incorporating these Terms.
2.3 	The Licensor will only provide Services to the Licensee further to a Quote. No Quote shall be binding on either party unless and until agreed by both parties.
2.4 	All Quotes entered into with the Licensee will be subject to the terms set out in these Terms. No terms or conditions endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in any quotation, estimate, correspondence, acknowledgement or acceptance of order or any similar document issued by the Licensee shall form part of any contract between the Licensor and the Licensee.
2.5 	The purchase of Additional Usage will entitle the Licensee to the provision of extended Support Services for a period of 1 year from the relevant Quote Effective Date (or such other period as expressly set out in any Quote).
2.6 	In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of these Terms and the terms of any Quote, the terms of the relevant Quote shall prevail only to the extent of any such conflict or inconsistency.

3. Provision of Software Materials and Support Services
3.1 	The Licensor shall make the Software Materials available in Source Code form at https://github.com/ag-grid on the first Quote Effective Date by provision of an activation key and any login details required to access the Software Materials, subject to payment of the Fees.
3.2 	Subject to clauses 3.3 and 3.4 below, the Licensor grants to the Licensee and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free licence (in the form of a Single Application and/or Multiple Applications Developer Licence), commencing on the relevant Quote Effective Date, to permit Licensee Developers to use the Software Materials (including taking all the actions permitted by clause 3.4 below) in accordance with these Terms, subject to the limit on the number of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the relevant Quote. Members within the group of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative members as long as the number of concurrent Licensee Developers at any time does not exceed the limit set out in the relevant Quote. For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying JavaScript code as part of the creation or Modification of an Application&#39;s user interface, which user interface creation or Modification uses the Software shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For example, if the Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript code with respect to the creation or Modification of the user interface of an Application and such creation or Modification uses the Software, but only two developers are directly working with the Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.
3.3 	Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if the relevant Quote specifies that a Deployment Licence Add-On is being granted by the Licensor to the Licensee then:
(a) 	subject to this clause 3.3, the licence granted in clause 3.2 shall be sub-licensable and subject to the limit on the number of permitted Production Environment(s) set out in the relevant Quote;
(b) 	subject to this clause 3.3 and clause 3.4(a), the Deployment Licence Add-On shall be subject to the same applicable licence restrictions as set out in these Terms; and
(c) 	the Licensee shall ensure (and shall procure that its Affiliates shall ensure) that the terms of any sub-licence are in writing and are substantially the same and as restrictive as the terms of these Terms (except that the sub-licensee shall not have the right to sub-licence its rights).
3.4 	The Licensee and its Affiliates may use the Software Materials to install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the Software Materials for production, test, archival, emergency re-start and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create derivative works from the Software Materials in the form of Applications, provided that:
(a) 	unless the relevant Quote specifies that a Deployment Licence Add-On is being granted by the Licensor to the Licensee, any Application created must be used for the Licensee&#39;s and its Affiliates&#39; internal business purposes only and must not be licensed to third parties; and
(b) 	the Licensee and its Affiliates shall not permit any end user of any Application to use the Software independently of, or by or with any applications other than, the Application being used by that end user.
3.5 	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee and its Affiliates shall be permitted to create Modifications to the Source Code to the Software for the Licensee&#39;s (and its Affiliates&#39;) use of the Software in accordance with these Terms. In the event that the Licensee and/or its Affiliates creates any Modifications to the Source Code to the Software, the Licensor shall not be obliged to provide the Support Services in relation to any such Modification(s) from the date on which any such Modification(s) take place.
3.6 	The Licensee and its Affiliates shall not change or remove the copyright notice from any of the files included in the Software Materials.
3.7 	The Licensee and its Affiliates shall not redistribute the Software Materials or any Modifications other than as expressly permitted by these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee and its Affiliates shall not redistribute the Software Materials or any Modifications:
(a) 	other than by including the Software or a portion of the Software within Application(s); and
(b) 	as part of any Application that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder, a user interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by software, application, or website developers or designers, or has a similar purpose or functionality (as determined by the Licensor).
