  \ PUBLIC LICENSE\n                           Version 2, June 1991\n\n         Copyright (C)\
  \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n       51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
  \ MA 02110-1301, USA\n\n    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of\n\
  \    this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n    Preamble\n\n    The licenses\
  \ for most software are designed to take away your\n    freedom to share and change it. By\
  \ contrast, the GNU General\n    Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share\
  \ and\n    change free software--to make sure the software is free for all\n    its users.\
  \ This General Public License applies to most of the Free\n    Software Foundation's software\
  \ and to any other program whose\n    authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software\
  \ Foundation\n    software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License\n    instead.)\
  \ You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\n    When we speak of free software, we are referring\
  \ to freedom, not\n    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n\
  \    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\n    charge for this\
  \ service if you wish), that you receive source code\n    or can get it if you want it, that\
  \ you can change the software or\n    use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you\
  \ know you can\n    do these things.\n\n    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
  \ that forbid\n    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\n    rights.\
  \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\n    for you if you distribute\
  \ copies of the software, or if you modify\n    it.\n\n    For example, if you distribute\
  \ copies of such a program, whether\n    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
  \ all the rights\n    that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can\n \
  \   get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\n    know their rights.\n\
  \n    We protect your rights with two steps:\n\n    (1) copyright the software, and\n    (2)\
  \ offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\n    copy, distribute and/or\
  \ modify the software.\n\n    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\n\
  \    certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\n    this free software.\
  \ If the software is modified by someone else\n    and passed on, we want its recipients to\
  \ know that what they have\n    is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others\n\
  \    will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\n    Finally, any free program\
  \ is threatened constantly by software\n    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors\
  \ of a free\n    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making\n    the\
  \ program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\n    that any patent must be\
  \ licensed for everyone's free use or not\n    licensed at all.\n\n    The precise terms and\
  \ conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.\n\n    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC\
  \ LICENSE\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n    0. This\
  \ License applies to any program or other work which\n    contains a notice placed by the\
  \ copyright holder saying it may be\n    distributed under the terms of this General Public\
  \ License. The\n    \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work\n\
  \    based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative\n    work under copyright\
  \ law: that is to say, a work containing the\n    Program or a portion of it, either verbatim\
  \ or with modifications\n    and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\n\
  \    is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\n    licensee is addressed\
  \ as \"you\".\n\n    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n  \
  \  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act\n    of running the Program\
  \ is not restricted, and the output from the\n    Program is covered only if its contents\
  \ constitute a work based on\n    the Program (independent of having been made by running\
  \ the\n    Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n    1. You\
  \ may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n    source code as you receive\
  \ it, in any medium, provided that you\n    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
  \ copy an\n    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep\n    intact all\
  \ the notices that refer to this License and to the\n    absence of any warranty; and give\
  \ any other recipients of the\n    Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\
  \n    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at\
  \ your option offer warranty protection in exchange\n    for a fee.\n\n    2. You may modify\
  \ your copy or copies of the Program or any\n    portion of it, thus forming a work based\
  \ on the Program, and copy\n    and distribute such modifications or work under the terms\
  \ of\n    Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these\n    conditions:\n\n \
  \   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you\
  \ changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you\
  \ distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program\
  \ or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties\
  \ under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
  \ interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive\
  \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate\
  \ copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n\
  \    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions,\
  \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License. (Exception: if the Program\
  \ itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based\
  \ on the\n    Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n    These requirements\
  \ apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not\
  \ derived from the\n    Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\n\
  \    works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\n    apply to those sections\
  \ when you distribute them as separate works.\n    But when you distribute the same sections\
  \ as part of a whole which\n    is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
  \ must\n    be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\n    licensees extend\
  \ to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\n    part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n\
  \    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n    contest your rights\
  \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the\n    intent is to exercise the right to control\
  \ the distribution of\n    derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\n    In\
  \ addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\n    Program with the Program\
  \ (or with a work based on the Program) on\n    a volume of a storage or distribution medium\
  \ does not bring the\n    other work under the scope of this License.\n\n    3. You may copy\
  \ and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n    under Section 2) in object code\
  \ or executable form under the terms\n    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also\
  \ do one of the\n    following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n\
  \    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above\
  \ on a medium customarily used for software\n    interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with\
  \ a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge\
  \ no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n \
  \   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the\
  \ terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange;\
  \ or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute\
  \ corresponding source code. (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution\
  \ and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n\
  \    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n    The source code for a work means\
  \ the preferred form of the work\n    for making modifications to it. For an executable work,\
  \ complete\n    source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n    plus\
  \ any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\n    used to control compilation\
  \ and installation of the executable.\n    However, as a special exception, the source code\
  \ distributed need\n    not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n   \
  \ source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\n    kernel, and so on) of the\
  \ operating system on which the executable\n    runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
  \ the executable.\n\n    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\
  \    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n    access to copy\
  \ the source code from the same place counts as\n    distribution of the source code, even\
  \ though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\
  \n    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n    except as expressly\
  \ provided under this License. Any attempt\n    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute\
  \ the Program is\n    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\n    License.\
  \ However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\n    from you under this License will\
  \ not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\
  \n    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it. However,\
  \ nothing else grants you permission to modify\n    or distribute the Program or its derivative\
  \ works. These actions\n    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\n   \
  \ Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\n    based on the Program),\
  \ you indicate your acceptance of this\n    License to do so, and all its terms and conditions\
  \ for copying,\n    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n    6.\
  \ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on\n    the Program), the recipient\
  \ automatically receives a license from\n    the original licensor to copy, distribute or\
  \ modify the Program\n    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any\n\
  \    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\n    granted herein. You\
  \ are not responsible for enforcing compliance\n    by third parties to this License.\n\n\
  \    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\n    patent infringement\
  \ or for any other reason (not limited to\n    patent issues), conditions are imposed on you\
  \ (whether by court\n    order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of\n\
  \    this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n    License. If you\
  \ cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\n    your obligations under this License\
  \ and any other pertinent\n    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\n\
  \    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\n    royalty-free redistribution\
  \ of the Program by all those who\n    receive copies directly or indirectly through you,\
  \ then the only\n    way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\n\
  \    entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n    If any portion of this section is held\
  \ invalid or unenforceable\n    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section\
  \ is\n    intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\n    in other\
  \ circumstances.\n\n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe\n\
  \    any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\n    of any such claims;\
  \ this section has the sole purpose of\n    protecting the integrity of the free software\
  \ distribution system,\n    which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\
  \ have\n    made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n    distributed through\
  \ that system in reliance on consistent\n    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor\
  \ to decide\n    if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other\n    system\
  \ and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n    This section is intended to make thoroughly\
  \ clear what is believed\n    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n    8. If\
  \ the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n    certain countries either\
  \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\n    the original copyright holder who places the\
  \ Program under this\n    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\n\
  \    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\n    in or among countries\
  \ not thus excluded. In such case, this\n    License incorporates the limitation as if written\
  \ in the body of\n    this License.\n\n    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
  \ and/or new\n    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n   \
  \ versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n    differ in detail\
  \ to address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version\
  \ number. If the\n    Program specifies a version number of this License which applies\n \
  \   to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\n    the terms and conditions\
  \ either of that version or of any later\n    version published by the Free Software Foundation.\
  \ If the Program\n    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\n\
  \    any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n    10. If you wish to\
  \ incorporate parts of the Program into other\n    free programs whose distribution conditions\
  \ are different, write\n    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\n \
  \   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n    Software Foundation;\
  \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\n    decision will be guided by the two goals\
  \ of preserving the free\n    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\n\
  \    the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n    \n    NO WARRANTY\n\n    11. BECAUSE\
  \ THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE\
  \ EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\n    LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
  \ HOLDERS\n    AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n    OF\
  \ ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\n    LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES\
  \ OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\n    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\
  \ QUALITY AND\n    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\n    DEFECTIVE,\
  \ YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR\n    OR CORRECTION.\n\n    12. IN\
  \ NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT\
  \ HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\n    MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
  \ ABOVE, BE\n    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n    INCIDENTAL\
  \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING\
  \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
  \ BY YOU\n    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\n    OTHER\
  \ PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\n    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\
  \ SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nSection 5 - GPLv3 License Agreement\n\
  \n                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                           Version 3,\
  \ 29 June 2007\n\n    Copyright c 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\n\
  \    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of\n    this license document,\
  \ but changing it is not allowed.\n\n    Preamble\n\n    The GNU General Public License is\
  \ a free, copyleft license for\n    software and other kinds of works.\n\n    The licenses\
  \ for most software and other practical works are\n    designed to take away your freedom\
  \ to share and change the works.\n    By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
  \ to\n    guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\n    program--to make\
  \ sure it remains free software for all its users.\n    We, the Free Software Foundation,\
  \ use the GNU General Public\n    License for most of our software; it applies also to any\
  \ other\n    work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your\n    programs,\
  \ too.\n\n    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n    price.\
  \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n    you have the freedom to\
  \ distribute copies of free software (and\n    charge for them if you wish), that you receive\
  \ source code or can\n    get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\n\
  \    pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\n    these things.\n\n\
  \    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n    these rights\
  \ or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\n    have certain responsibilities\
  \ if you distribute copies of the\n    software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\
  \ respect the\n    freedom of others.\n\n    For example, if you distribute copies of such\
  \ a program, whether\n    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n\
  \    freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,\n    receive or can get\
  \ the source code. And you must show them these\n    terms so they know their rights.\n\n\
  \    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two\n    steps: (1) assert copyright\
  \ on the software, and (2) offer you\n    this License giving you legal permission to copy,\
  \ distribute\n    and/or modify it.\n\n    For the developers' and authors' protection, the\
  \ GPL clearly\n    explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\n    both\
  \ users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified\n    versions be marked as changed,\
  \ so that their problems will not be\n    attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\
  \n    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n    modified versions\
  \ of the software inside them, although the\n    manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally\
  \ incompatible with\n    the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\n\
  \    systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products\n    for individuals\
  \ to use, which is precisely where it is most\n    unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\
  \ this version of the GPL\n    to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems\n\
  \    arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend\n    this provision to\
  \ those domains in future versions of the GPL, as\n    needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\
  \n    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software\n    patents. States should\
  \ not allow patents to restrict development\n    and use of software on general-purpose computers,\
  \ but in those\n    that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied\n  \
  \  to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To\n    prevent this, the GPL\
  \ assures that patents cannot be used to\n    render the program non-free.\n\n    The precise\
  \ terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.\n\n    TERMS\
  \ AND CONDITIONS\n\n    0. Definitions.\n\n    \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the\
  \ GNU General Public\n    License.\n\n    \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that\
  \ apply to other\n    kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n    \"The Program\"\
  \ refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n    License. Each licensee is addressed\
  \ as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n    \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\
  \n    To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the\n    work in a fashion\
  \ requiring copyright permission, other than the\n    making of an exact copy. The resulting\
  \ work is called a \"modified\n    version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the\
  \ earlier\n    work.\n\n    A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work\n\
  \    based on the Program.\n\n    To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that,\
  \ without\n    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n    infringement\
  \ under applicable copyright law, except executing it\n    on a computer or modifying a private\
  \ copy. Propagation includes\n    copying, distribution (with or without modification), making\n\
  \    available to the public, and in some countries other activities as\n    well.\n\n   \
  \ To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables\n    other parties to make\
  \ or receive copies. Mere interaction with a\n    user through a computer network, with no\
  \ transfer of a copy, is\n    not conveying.\n\n    An interactive user interface displays\
  \ \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently\n\
  \    visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\n    and (2) tells\
  \ the user that there is no warranty for the work\n    (except to the extent that warranties\
  \ are provided), that\n    licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view\n\
  \    a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user\n    commands or options,\
  \ such as a menu, a prominent item in the list\n    meets this criterion.\n\n    1. Source\
  \ Code.\n\n    The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n    for\
  \ making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\n    form of a work.\n\n\
  \    A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an\n    official standard\
  \ defined by a recognized standards body, or, in\n    the case of interfaces specified for\
  \ a particular programming\n    language, one that is widely used among developers working\
  \ in that\n    language.\n\n    The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything,\n\
  \    other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal\n    form of packaging\
  \ a Major Component, but which is not part of that\n    Major Component, and (b) serves only\
  \ to enable use of the work\n    with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface\n\
  \    for which an implementation is available to the public in source\n    code form. A \"\
  Major Component\", in this context, means a major\n    essential component (kernel, window\
  \ system, and so on) of the\n    specific operating system (if any) on which the executable\
  \ work\n    runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\n    interpreter\
  \ used to run it.\n\n    The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means\n\
  \    all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an\n    executable work) run\
  \ the object code and to modify the work,\n    including scripts to control those activities.\
  \ However, it does\n    not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools\n\
  \    or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in\n    performing those\
  \ activities but which are not part of the work.\n    For example, Corresponding Source includes\
  \ interface definition\n    files associated with source files for the work, and the source\n\
  \    code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that\n    the work is specifically\
  \ designed to require, such as by intimate\n    data communication or control flow between\
  \ those subprograms and\n    other parts of the work.\n\n    The Corresponding Source need\
  \ not include anything that users can\n    regenerate automatically from other parts of the\
  \ Corresponding\n    Source.\n\n    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form\
  \ is that\n    same work.\n\n    2. Basic Permissions.\n\n    All rights granted under this\
  \ License are granted for the term of\n    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided\
  \ the stated\n    conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n   \
  \ permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running\n    a covered work is\
  \ covered by this License only if the output,\n    given its content, constitutes a covered\
  \ work. This License\n    acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as\n \
  \   provided by copyright law.\n\n    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you\
  \ do not\n    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise\n    remains in\
  \ force. You may convey covered works to others for the\n    sole purpose of having them make\
  \ modifications exclusively for\n    you, or provide you with facilities for running those\
  \ works,\n    provided that you comply with the terms of this License in\n    conveying all\
  \ material for which you do not control copyright.\n    Those thus making or running the covered\
  \ works for you must do\n    so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control,\n\
  \    on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\n    copyrighted material\
  \ outside their relationship with you.\n\n    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted\
  \ solely under\n    the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section\n  \
  \  10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention\
  \ Law.\n\n    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n    measure\
  \ under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under\n    article 11 of the WIPO copyright\
  \ treaty adopted on 20 December\n    1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\
  \ of\n    such measures.\n\n    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power\
  \ to\n    forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such\n    circumvention\
  \ is effected by exercising rights under this License\n    with respect to the covered work,\
  \ and you disclaim any intention\n    to limit operation or modification of the work as a\
  \ means of\n    enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal\n    rights\
  \ to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\
  \n    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n    receive it,\
  \ in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n    appropriately publish on each copy\
  \ an appropriate copyright\n    notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License\
  \ and any\n    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the\n    code;\
  \ keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;\n    and give all recipients a copy\
  \ of this License along with the\n    Program.\n\n    You may charge any price or no price\
  \ for each copy that you\n    convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for\
  \ a\n    fee.\n\n    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n    You may convey a work based\
  \ on the Program, or the modifications\n    to produce it from the Program, in the form of\
  \ source code under\n    the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\n\
  \    conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n\
  \    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating\
  \ that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n   \
  \ 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep\n    intact all notices\"\
  .\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone\
  \ who comes into possession of a copy. This\n    License will therefore apply, along with\
  \ any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n\
  \    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n    permission to license\
  \ the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately\
  \ received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n\
  \    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that\
  \ do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n \
  \   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and\n    independent works, which\
  \ are not by their nature extensions of the\n    covered work, and which are not combined\
  \ with it such as to form a\n    larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\n\
  \    medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its\n    resulting copyright\
  \ are not used to limit the access or legal\n    rights of the compilation's users beyond\
  \ what the individual works\n    permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does\
  \ not cause\n    this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n    6. Conveying\
  \ Non-Source Forms.\n\n    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n\
  \    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-\n    readable Corresponding\
  \ Source under the terms of this License, in\n    one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the\
  \ object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution\
  \ medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n\
  \    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
  \ in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n\
  \    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer\
  \ spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses\
  \ the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software\
  \ in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily\
  \ used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically\
  \ performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source\
  \ from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code\
  \ with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative\
  \ is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object\
  \ code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object\
  \ code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer\
  \ equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place\
  \ at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding\
  \ Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network\
  \ server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a\
  \ third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n \
  \   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.\
  \ Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure\
  \ that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e)\
  \ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n    provided you inform other peers\
  \ where the object code and\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the\
  \ general\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n    A separable portion of the\
  \ object code, whose source code is\n    excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System\
  \ Library, need\n    not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\n    A \"User Product\"\
  \ is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means\n    any tangible personal property which\
  \ is normally used for\n    personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed\n\
  \    or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether\n    a product is a\
  \ consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved\n    in favor of coverage. For a particular\
  \ product received by a\n    particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common\
  \ use\n    of that class of product, regardless of the status of the\n    particular user\
  \ or of the way in which the particular user\n    actually uses, or expects or is expected\
  \ to use, the product. A\n    product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product\n\
  \    has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,\n    unless such uses represent\
  \ the only significant mode of use of the\n    product.\n\n    \"Installation Information\"\
  \ for a User Product means any methods,\n    procedures, authorization keys, or other information\
  \ required to\n    install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that\n    User\
  \ Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.\n    The information must suffice\
  \ to ensure that the continued\n    functioning of the modified object code is in no case\
  \ prevented or\n    interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n    If you\
  \ convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\n    or specifically for use\
  \ in, a User Product, and the conveying\n    occurs as part of a transaction in which the\
  \ right of possession\n    and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\n\
  \    perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\n    is characterized),\
  \ the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\n    section must be accompanied by the Installation\
  \ Information. But\n    this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party\n\
  \    retains the ability to install modified object code on the User\n    Product (for example,\
  \ the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n    The requirement to provide Installation Information\
  \ does not\n    include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\n    warranty,\
  \ or updates for a work that has been modified or\n    installed by the recipient, or for\
  \ the User Product in which it\n    has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
  \ be denied\n    when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\n    operation\
  \ of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\n    communication across the network.\n\
  \n    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\n    provided, in accord\
  \ with this section must be in a format that is\n    publicly documented (and with an implementation\
  \ available to the\n    public in source code form), and must require no special password\n\
  \    or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n    7. Additional Terms.\n\n    \"Additional\
  \ permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of\n    this License by making exceptions\
  \ from one or more of its\n    conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the\n\
  \    entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in\n    this License, to\
  \ the extent that they are valid under applicable\n    law. If additional permissions apply\
  \ only to part of the Program,\n    that part may be used separately under those permissions,\
  \ but the\n    entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to\n    the\
  \ additional permissions.\n\n    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your\
  \ option\n    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\n    of it.\
  \ (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n    removal in certain cases\
  \ when you modify the work.) You may place\n    additional permissions on material, added\
  \ by you to a covered\n    work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\n  \
  \  permission.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material\n\
  \    you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright\n    holders of that\
  \ material) supplement the terms of this License\n    with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty\
  \ or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License;\
  \ or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author\
  \ attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works\
  \ containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n\
  \    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways\
  \ as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes\
  \ of names of licensors\n    or authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights\
  \ under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\
  \n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone\
  \ who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions\
  \ of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions\
  \ directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n    All other non-permissive additional\
  \ terms are considered \"further\n    restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If\
  \ the Program as\n    you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that\n\
  \    it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n    restriction,\
  \ you may remove that term. If a license document\n    contains a further restriction but\
  \ permits relicensing or\n    conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work\n\
  \    material governed by the terms of that license document, provided\n    that the further\
  \ restriction does not survive such relicensing or\n    conveying.\n\n    If you add terms\
  \ to a covered work in accord with this section,\n    you must place, in the relevant source\
  \ files, a statement of the\n    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n\
  \    where to find the applicable terms.\n\n    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,\
  \ may be stated in\n    the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n\
  \    the above requirements apply either way.\n\n    8. Termination.\n\n    You may not propagate\
  \ or modify a covered work except as expressly\n    provided under this License. Any attempt\
  \ otherwise to propagate or\n    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your\
  \ rights\n    under this License (including any patent licenses granted under\n    the third\
  \ paragraph of section 11).\n\n    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then\
  \ your\n    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n    provisionally,\
  \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\n    and finally terminates your license,\
  \ and (b) permanently, if the\n    copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by\
  \ some\n    reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n    Moreover, your license\
  \ from a particular copyright holder is\n    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder\
  \ notifies you of the\n    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you\n\
  \    have received notice of violation of this License (for any work)\n    from that copyright\
  \ holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30\n    days after your receipt of the notice.\n\
  \n    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate\n    the licenses of\
  \ parties who have received copies or rights from\n    you under this License. If your rights\
  \ have been terminated and\n    not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive\
  \ new\n    licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n    9. Acceptance Not Required\
  \ for Having Copies.\n\n    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive\
  \ or\n    run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n    occurring\
  \ solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\n    transmission to receive a copy likewise\
  \ does not require\n    acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you\n\
  \    permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions\n    infringe copyright\
  \ if you do not accept this License. Therefore,\n    by modifying or propagating a covered\
  \ work, you indicate your\n    acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n    10. Automatic Licensing\
  \ of Downstream Recipients.\n\n    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n\
  \    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n    propagate that\
  \ work, subject to this License. You are not\n    responsible for enforcing compliance by\
  \ third parties with this\n    License.\n\n    An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
  \ transferring control of\n    an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or\n \
  \   subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If\n    propagation of a covered\
  \ work results from an entity transaction,\n    each party to that transaction who receives\
  \ a copy of the work\n    also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's\n    predecessor\
  \ in interest had or could give under the previous\n    paragraph, plus a right to possession\
  \ of the Corresponding Source\n    of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\n\
  \    has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n    You may not impose any further restrictions\
  \ on the exercise of the\n    rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example,\
  \ you\n    may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\n    exercise of rights\
  \ granted under this License, and you may not\n    initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
  \ or counterclaim in a\n    lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,\n\
  \    using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any\n    portion of it.\n\
  \n    11. Patents.\n\n    A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under\n\
  \    this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is\n    based. The work thus\
  \ licensed is called the contributor's\n    \"contributor version\".\n\n    A contributor's\
  \ \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n    owned or controlled by the contributor,\
  \ whether already acquired\n    or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,\n\
  \    permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its\n    contributor version,\
  \ but do not include claims that would be\n    infringed only as a consequence of further\
  \ modification of the\n    contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\"\
  \n    includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner\n    consistent with the\
  \ requirements of this License.\n\n    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\
  \ royalty-\n    free patent license under the contributor's essential patent\n    claims,\
  \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise\n    run, modify and propagate\
  \ the contents of its contributor version.\n\n    In the following three paragraphs, a \"\
  patent license\" is any\n    express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n\
  \    enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a\n    patent or covenant\
  \ not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\"\n    such a patent license to a party\
  \ means to make such an agreement\n    or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\
  \n    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent\n    license, and the Corresponding\
  \ Source of the work is not available\n    for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the\
  \ terms of this\n    License, through a publicly available network server or other\n    readily\
  \ accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the\n    Corresponding Source to be so\
  \ available, or (2) arrange to deprive\n    yourself of the benefit of the patent license\
  \ for this particular\n    work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements\n\
  \    of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\n    recipients. \"Knowingly\
  \ relying\" means you have actual knowledge\n    that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
  \ the covered work\n    in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a\n \
  \   country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n    country that you\
  \ have reason to believe are valid.\n\n    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single\
  \ transaction or\n    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,\n\
  \    a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n    receiving the\
  \ covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,\n    modify or convey a specific copy of\
  \ the covered work, then the\n    patent license you grant is automatically extended to all\n\
  \    recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n    A patent license is \"discriminatory\"\
  \ if it does not include within\n    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,\
  \ or is\n    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that\n    are specifically\
  \ granted under this License. You may not convey a\n    covered work if you are a party to\
  \ an arrangement with a third\n    party that is in the business of distributing software,\
  \ under\n    which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of\n    your activity\
  \ of conveying the work, and under which the third\n    party grants, to any of the parties\
  \ who would receive the covered\n    work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in\
  \ connection\n    with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made\n    from\
  \ those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with\n    specific products or compilations\
  \ that contain the covered work,\n    unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\
  \ license\n    was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n    Nothing in this License shall be\
  \ construed as excluding or\n    limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\n\
  \    that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent\n    law.\n\n    12. No\
  \ Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
  \ order,\n    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\n    License,\
  \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n    License. If you cannot convey a\
  \ covered work so as to satisfy\n    simultaneously your obligations under this License and\
  \ any other\n    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it\n    at\
  \ all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to\n    collect a royalty for\
  \ further conveying from those to whom you\n    convey the Program, the only way you could\
  \ satisfy both those\n    terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying\n\
  \    the Program.\n\n    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n    Notwithstanding\
  \ any other provision of this License, you have\n    permission to link or combine any covered\
  \ work with a work\n    licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License\n\
  \    into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\n    terms of this\
  \ License will continue to apply to the part which is\n    the covered work, but the special\
  \ requirements of the GNU Affero\n    General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\
  \ through\n    a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n    14. Revised Versions\
  \ of this License.\n\n    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n  \
  \  versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\n    new versions will\
  \ be similar in spirit to the present version, but\n    may differ in detail to address new\
  \ problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n\
  \    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n    General Public License\
  \ \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\n    have the option of following the terms\
  \ and conditions either of\n    that numbered version or of any later version published by\
  \ the\n    Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\n    version number\
  \ of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\n    any version ever published by the\
  \ Free Software Foundation.\n\n    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which\
  \ future\n    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\n    proxy's public\
  \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n    authorizes you to choose that version\
  \ for the Program.\n\n    Later license versions may give you additional or different\n  \
  \  permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n    author or copyright\
  \ holder as a result of your choosing to follow\n    a later version.\n\n    15. Disclaimer\
  \ of Warranty.\n\n    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n \
  \   APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE\n    COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\
  \ OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\"\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\
  \ OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n    MERCHANTABILITY\
  \ AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE\n    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\
  \ OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\n    SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
  \ OF ALL\n    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n    16. Limitation of Liability.\n\
  \n    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY\
  \ COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES\n    AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
  \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n\
  \    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\n    THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING\
  \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n    BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
  \ BY YOU OR THIRD\n    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n   \
  \ PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF\n    THE POSSIBILITY OF\
  \ SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n    If the disclaimer\
  \ of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n    above cannot be given local legal\
  \ effect according to their terms,\n    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely\n\
  \    approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\n    connection with the Program,\
  \ unless a warranty or assumption of\n    liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return\
  \ for a fee.\n\n\nSection 6 - 3rd Party Components\n\n(1) The Software Program includes software\
