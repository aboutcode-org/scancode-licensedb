The Controller invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence.\n\nThe Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown. The extent of the Controller\u2019s offer to license this Information under the terms of this licence is set out on The National Archives website.\n\nThis is version 2.0 of the Open Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Open Government Licence. If you are already using Information under a previous version of the Open Government Licence, the terms of that licence will continue to apply.\n\nThese terms are compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License, both of which license copyright and database rights. This means that when the Information is adapted and licensed under either of those licences, you automatically satisfy the conditions of the OGL when you comply with the other licence. The OGLv2.0 is Open Definition compliant.\n\nFurther context, best practice and guidance can be found in the UK Government Licensing Framework section on The National Archives website."
