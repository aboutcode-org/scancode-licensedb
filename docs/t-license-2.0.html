Provided, however, that the said Developer may select to Distribute the said Derivative Work of the Source Code under the terms and conditions set forth in the Existing License Agreement.
    The Developer shall be obligated to give a notice that the Source Code is used, in such a way as separately established by TRON Forum, when they use the Source Code or the Derivative Work of the Source Code, or make the Binary Code available to the End User on the Embedded Product. Provided, however, that the Developer shall be released from the obligation to give a notice under this Article in the event of the following:
        The Developer, who is a member of TRON Forum, applies for said release to TRON Forum in a manner separately determined by TRON Forum.
