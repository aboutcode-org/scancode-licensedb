If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You relative to the Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Distribution. If You distribute or reproduce copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, You must:

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

11. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL Licensor OR ANY Contributor, OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEDICAL OR PROFESSIONAL STAFF, EMPLOYEES, STUDENTS, VOLUNTEERS, AGENTS, AND/OR ATTORNEYS BE LIABLE TO You, OR ANY Contributor, OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, SUBCONTRACTORS, CUSTOMERS, SUBLICENSEES OR DISTRIBUTORS FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS License OR RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, HOWEVER CAUSED INCLUDING ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ECONOMIC DAMAGES OR INJURY TO PROPERTY OR LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER You OR ANY Contributor SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING. SUBJECT IN ANY EVENT TO THE LIMITATIONS IN THE FOREGOING SENTENCE, THE LIABILITY OF You AND Your AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEDICAL OR PROFESSIONAL STAFF, STUDENTS, VOLUNTEERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND ATTORNEYS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS, HEIRS AND ASSIGNS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL SUITS, ACTIONS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, COSTS AND EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY OBLIGATION UNDER THIS License WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE A SUM EQUAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID TO Licensor OR THE Contributor, AS THE CASE MAY BE, UNDER THIS License. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

12. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if in Your license to Your sublicensees You also agree with each sublicensee to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless form any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, each Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. You agree to be responsible to Licensor and liable for the acts and omissions of Your sublicensees that constitute a breach of this License as if such acts or omissions were Your acts or omissions, and You shall be responsible for and indemnify Contributors for You and Your sublicensee’s compliance with this License. Your indemnification obligations under this License mean that You, at Your sole expense, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all Contributors and their owners, members and affiliates, sublicensees, subcontractors, and distributors and each of their respective trustees, directors, officers, medical and professional staff, employees, students, volunteers, attorneys, and agents and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (the “Indemnitees”), against any and all liability, damage (including direct, indirect, consequential and special damages), loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses)(each a “Loss”), incurred by or imposed upon the Indemnitees or any one of them in connection with any third-party claims, suits, actions, investigations, demands, or judgments relating to or arising from, in whole or part: (i) any theory of contractual or product liability (including, but not limited to, actions in the form of contract, tort, warranty, or strict liability) concerning the Software or any licensed product, product, process or service made, used, or sold or performed pursuant to any right or license granted under this License, or (ii) any claim by a third-party that any product, process or service made, used, sold, or performed of or through You pursuant to any right or license granted under this License infringes any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property, or breach of Your or Your sublicensees obligations under this License; except to the extent You can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that a Loss as described in this Section directly results from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Contributors. 

13. Interpretation. The section and other headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not be definitive of the interpretation of this License. Whenever the context reasonably permits, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the whole shall include any part thereof. Any waiver of this License must be in writing and any waiver of one event shall not be construed as a waiver of subsequent events. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be limited, narrowed, construed and altered as necessary to render it valid, but only to the extent necessary to achieve such validity.  If necessary, the invalid provision shall be eliminated from this License. The remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer this License.</code></pre>
