  \ Source Code Availability.  You agree to provide all Your Error Corrections to Original Contributor\
  \ as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, prior to Internal Deployment Use or\
  \ Commercial Use, if applicable.  Original Contributor may, at its discretion, post Source\
  \ Code for Your Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on the Community Webserver.  You\
  \ may also post Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on a web-server of Your choice;\
  \ provided, that You must take reasonable precautions to ensure that only Licensees have access\
  \ to such Error Corrections and Shared Modifications.  Such precautions shall include, without\
  \ limitation, a password protection scheme limited to Licensees and a click-on, download certification\

  \ to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include\
  \ the notice in a\nlocation (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be\
  \ most likely to look for such a notice.\n\nd) Redistribution.\n\n(i) Source.  Covered Code\
  \ may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Licensee (except for\nstudents as\
  \ provided below).  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the\
  \ rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Licensee.  You may distribute Covered\
  \ Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken\
  \ at accredited educational institutions.  Such students need not be Licensees, but must be\
  \ given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included\
  \ in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.\n\
  \n(ii) Executable.  You may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Licensees\
  \ and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with\
  \ Research Use by You and under a license of Your choice, but which limits use of such Executable\n\
  version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\n\n(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package\
  \ Naming. In connection with Research Use by You only, You may use Original Contributor's\
  \ class, interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code\
  \ files You modify.  Original Contributor grants to You a limited license to the extent necessary\
  \ for such purposes.\n\n(iv) Modifications.  You expressly agree that any distribution, in\
  \ whole or in part, of Modifications\ndeveloped by You shall only be done pursuant to the\
  \ term and conditions of this License.\n\ne) Extensions.\n\n(i) Covered Code.  You may not\
  \ include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions;\n\n(ii) Publication.  No later\
  \ than the date on which You first distribute such Extension for Commercial Use, You must\
  \ publish to the industry, on a non-confidential basis and free of all copyright restrictions\
  \ with respect to reproduction and use, an accurate and current specification for any Extension.\
  \  In addition, You must make available an appropriate test suite, pursuant to the same rights\
  \ as the specification, sufficiently detailed to allow any third party reasonably skilled\
  \ in the technology to produce implementations of the Extension compatible with the specification.\
  \  Such test suites must be made available as soon as reasonably practicable but, in no event,\
  \ later than ninety (90) days after Your first Commercial Use of the Extension.  You must\
  \ use reasonable efforts to promptly clarify and correct the specification and the test suite\
  \ upon written request by Original Contributor.\n\n(iii) Open.  You agree to refrain from\
  \ enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your\
  \ Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such interface(s) by Original Contributor\
  \ or any Licensee.  This obligation does not prevent You from\nenforcing any Intellectual\
  \ Property Right You have that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Your Extension.\n\
  \n(iv) Class, Interface and Package Naming.  You may not add any packages, or any public or\
  \ protected classes or interfaces with names that originate or might appear to originate from\
  \ Original Contributor including, without limitation, package or class names which begin with\
  \ \"sun\", \"java\", \"javax\", \"jini\", \"net.jini\", \"com.sun\" or their equivalents in\
  \ any subsequent class, interface and/or package naming convention adopted by Original Contributor.\
  \  It is specifically suggested that You name any new packages using the \"Unique Package\
  \ Naming Convention\" as described in \"The Java Language Specification\" by James Gosling,\
  \ Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN 0-201-63451-1, August 1996.\nSection 7.7 \"Unique Package\
  \ Names\", on page 125 of this specification which states, in part:\n\n\"You form a unique\
  \ package name by first having (or belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domain\
  \ name, such as \"sun.com\".  You then reverse the name, component by component, to obtain,\
  \ in this example, \"Com.sun\", and use this as a prefix for Your package names, using a convention\
  \ developed within Your organization to further administer package names.\"\n\n3.2.  Additional\
  \ Requirements and Responsibilities.  Any additional requirements and responsibilities relating\
  \ to the Technology are listed in Attachment F (Additional Requirements and Responsibilities),\
  \ if applicable, and are hereby incorporated into this Section 3.\n\n4.  Versions of the License.\n\
  \n4.1.  License Versions.  Original Contributor may publish revised versions of the License\
  \ from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n4.2.\

  \ the License, You may always continue to use such Covered Code under the terms of that version\
  \ of the License.  You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent\
  \ version of\nthe License.  No one other than Original Contributor has the right to promulgate\
  \ License versions.\n\n5.  Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n5.1.  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER\
  \ THIS LICENSE \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\

  \ works of the TCK or use the TCK to test any implementation of the Specification that is\
  \ not Covered Code.  You may not publish your test results or make claims of comparative compatibility\
  \ with respect to other implementations of the Specification.  In consideration for the license\
  \ grant in Section 1.a above you agree not to develop your own tests which are intended to\
  \ validate conformation with the Specification.\n\n2.  Requirements for Determining Compliance.\n\
  \n2.1.  Definitions.\n\na) \"Added Value\" means code which:\n\n\t(i) has a principal purpose\
  \ which is substantially different from that of the stand-alone Technology;\n\n\t(ii) represents\
  \ a significant functional and value enhancement to the Technology;\n\n\t(iii) operates in\
  \ conjunction with the Technology; and\n\n\t(iv) is not marketed as a technology which replaces\
  \ or substitutes for the Technology.\n\nb) \"Java Classes\" means the specific class libraries\
  \ associated with each Technology defined in Attachment B.\n\nc) \"Java Runtime Interpreter\"\
  \ means the program(s) which implement the Java virtual machine for the Technology as defined\
  \ in the Specification.\n\nd) \"Platform Dependent Part\" means those Original Code and Upgraded\
  \ Code files of the Technology which are not in a share directory or subdirectory thereof.\n\
  \ne) \"Shared Part\" means those Original Code and Upgraded Code files of the Technology which\
  \ are identified as \"shared\" (or words of similar meaning) or which are in any \"share\"\
  \ directory or subdirectory thereof, except those files specifically designated by Original\
  \ Contributor as modifiable.\n\nf) \"User's Guide\" means the users guide for the TCK which\
  \ Original Contributor makes available to You to provide direction in how to run the TCK and\
  \ properly interpret the results, as may be revised by Original Contributor from time to time.\n\
  \n2.2.  Development Restrictions.  Compliant Covered Code:\n\n\ta) must include Added Value;\n\
  \n\tb) must fully comply with the Specifications for the Technology specified in Attachment\
  \ B;\n\n\tc) must include the Shared Part, complete and unmodified;\n\n\td) may not modify\
  \ the functional behavior of the Java Runtime Interpreter or the Java Classes;\n\n\te) may\
  \ not modify, subset or superset the interfaces of the Java Runtime Interpreter or the Java\
  \ Classes;\n\n\tf) may not subset or superset the Java Classes;\n\n\tg) may not modify or\
  \ extend the required public class or public interface declarations whose names begin with\
  \ \"java\", \"javax\", \"jini\", \"net.jini\", \"sun.hotjava\", \"COM.sun\" or their equivalents\
  \ in any subsequent naming convention;\n\n\th) Profiles.  The following provisions apply if\
  \ You are licensing a  Java Platform, Micro Edition Connected Device Configuration,  Java\
  \ Platform, Micro Edition Connected Limited Device Configuration and/or a Profile:\n\n\t\t\
  (i)\tProfiles may not include an implementation of any part of a Profile or use any of the\
  \ APIs within a Profile, unless You implement the Profile in its entirety in conformance with\
  \ the applicable compatibility requirements and test suites as developed and licensed by Original\
  \ Contributor or other authorized party.  \"Profile\" means: (A) for Java Platform, Micro\
  \ Edition Connected Device Configuration,  Foundation Profile, Personal Profile or such other\
  \ profile as may be developed under or in connection with the Java Community Process or as\
  \ otherwise authorized by Original Contributor; (B) for Java Platform, Micro Edition Connected\
  \ Limited Device Configuration, Java Platform, Micro Edition, Mobile Information Device Profile\
  \ or such other profile as may be developed under or in connection with the Java Community\
  \ Process or as otherwise authorized by Original Contributor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,\
  \ nothing herein shall be construed as eliminating or modifying Your obligation to include\
  \ Added Value as set forth in Section 2.2(a), above; and\n\n\t\t(ii) \tProfile(s) must be\
  \ tightly integrated with, and must be configured to run in conjunction with, an implementation\
  \ of a Configuration  from Original Contributor (or an authorized third party) which meets\
  \ Original Contributor's compatibility requirements.  \"Configuration\" means, as defined\
  \ in Original Contributor's compatibility requirements, either (A) Java Platform, Micro Edition\
  \ Connected Device Configuration; or (B) Java Platform, Micro Edition Connected Limited Device\
  \ Configuration. \n\n\t\t(iii)\tA Profile as integrated with a Configuration must pass the\
  \ applicable TCK for the Technology. \n\n2.3.  Compatibility Testing.  Successful compatibility\
  \ testing must be completed by You, or at Original\nContributor's option, a third party designated\
  \ by Original Contributor to conduct such tests, in accordance with the User's Guide.  A Technology\
  \  must pass the applicable TCK for the Technology.  You must use the most current version\
  \ of the applicable TCK available from Original Contributor one hundred twenty (120) days\
  \ (two hundred forty [240] days in the case of silicon implementations) prior to:  (i) Your\
  \ Internal Deployment Use; and (ii) each release of Compliant Covered Code by You for Commercial\
  \ Use.  In the event that You elect to use a version of Upgraded Code that is newer than that\
  \ which is required under this Section 2.3, then You agree to pass the version of the TCK\
  \ that corresponds to such newer version of Upgraded Code.\n\n2.4.  Test Results.  You agree\
  \ to provide to Original Contributor or the third party test facility if applicable, Your\
  \ test results that demonstrate that Covered Code is Compliant Covered Code and that Original\
  \ Contributor may publish or otherwise distribute such test results."
