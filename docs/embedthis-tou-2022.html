Welcome to EmbedThis

Embedthis Software, LLC. provides this web site, the services available via this web site, and associated embedded device Software (the “Service”) to you (“You”) subject to the following Terms of Use (“Terms”). By using the Service you accept the Terms and agree to be bound by the current Terms displayed on the Embedthis web site.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE INDICATES YOUR FULL ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE TERMS DISALLOWS USE OF THE SERVICE AND MAY GIVE RISE TO UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES.

1.1. Subject to the conditions of these Terms and receipt by Embedthis of all payments due under these Terms, You are hereby granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted herein) right to:

b. Use, demonstrate, distribute, market, promote, rent, reproduce and sell Integrated Products containing the Software in binary form only, including the ability to provide remote access to Integrated Products via cloud services.

c. Distribute the Software in source code form to Your contract manufacturers for the sole purpose of creating Integrated Products for You. This does not include the right to sublicense the Software, nor does it permit contract manufacturers to distribute or sell the Software except in binary form when part of Your Integrated Product and sold directly to You.

d. Use and interact with the Service using the documented published APIs of the Service for the sole purpose of managing Your Integrated Products.

1.2 You will maintain a valid billing card with the Service and immediately pay all Service fees immediately they become due, unless You have a prior contractual billing agreement with Embedthis that specifies alternate payment terms.

1.3 You agree that You will not take any action that interferes, or attempts to interfere with the proper working of the Service or imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the Service as determined solely by Embedthis. You agree that you will not use the Service in any manner other than as expressly authorized by these Terms.

1.4 You agree to keep accurate records relating to the number of devices you create using the Software and Embedthis shall have the right to verify Your compliance with these terms and your subscription volume, at our expense, during the term of this agreement and for a period of one year thereafter. In such case, we will engage an independent accountant from a nationally recognized public accounting firm, which will be subject to a confidentiality obligation. Verification will take place upon not fewer than 30 days notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does not interfere unreasonably with your operations.
2. Termination

2.1.

2.2. You understand and agree that the cancellation of your account is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with Embedthis. This includes, but is not limited to, any dispute related to, or arising out of: (a) any item of the Terms or Embedthis’s enforcement or application of the Terms; (b) any policy or practice of Embedthis, including the operation of the Service, your ability to access and use the Service, or Embedthis’s governance of the Service.

2.3. Embedthis may, at its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement if the Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days. Embedthis will not be liable to You for the termination of your account.

2.4 If Embedthis and its successors cease to operate in the ordinary course of business, Your rights granted in this Section 2, including the ability to create and sell Integrated Products, shall continue unaffected. In this event, if you are subscribed at that time to the Service, You are granted an option for a period of sixty (60) days from such event, at your election, to acquire at no charge, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for the Builder software code required to host the Service including the right to compile, host, execute, market and promote this Builder software only as required to run the Service for your Integrated Products.
3. Assignment
