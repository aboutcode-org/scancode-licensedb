  "text": "MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\n \nThese license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software in this container and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft's rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.\n\n1. SCOPE OF LICENSE.\n    a) General. The software is a collection of components. Subject to the other terms of this agreement, Microsoft or third parties grant you the right to run, copy, modify, and redistribute the components under the conditions in the license agreement located in that component's source or object code. \n    b) Trademark. This agreement does not grant you any right, title, interest, or license in or to any of the Microsoft's trademarks, trade names, trade dress, or logos. You may use Microsoft's corporate name, Product names, and trademarks in plain text (but not logos, trade dress, designs, or word marks in stylized form) to accurately identify and refer to Microsoft and its software. However, in making such references, you must refrain from use that is likely to cause confusion about your relationship with Microsoft and must comply with Microsoft's usage guidelines at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/Trademarks/EN-US.aspx . You will promptly correct any misuse on notice from Microsoft. \n\n2. DATA. \n    a) Data Collection. When an optional telemetry package is installed, the software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of data collection by removing the telemetry package. You can learn more about data collection and use in the software documentation and the privacy statement at https://aka.ms/privacy. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.\n    b) Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.\n\n3. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.\n\n4. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is \"as is\", \"with all faults\", and without warranty of any kind. \n\n5. UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.\n\n6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.\n\n7. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.\n\n8. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\n    a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\n    b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\n    c) Germany and Austria.\n        i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.\n        ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.\n\n    Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\n\n9.DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED \"AS IS.\" YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n10. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\n\nThis limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nIt also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.\n\nPlease note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.\n\nRemarque: Ce logiciel \u00e9tant distribu\u00e9 au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en fran\u00e7ais.\n\nEXON\u00c9RATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel vis\u00e9 par une licence est offert \u00ab tel quel \u00bb. Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est \u00e0 votre seule risque et p\u00e9ril. Microsoft n'accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualit\u00e9 marchande, d'ad\u00e9quation \u00e0 un usage particulier et d'absence de contrefa\u00e7on sont exclues.\n\nLIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INT\u00c9R\u00caTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILIT\u00c9 POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement \u00e0 hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages sp\u00e9ciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices.\n\nCette limitation concerne:\n    \u2022tout ce qui est reli\u00e9 au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et\n    \u2022les r\u00e9clamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilit\u00e9 stricte, de n\u00e9gligence ou d'une autre faute dans la limite autoris\u00e9e par la loi en vigueur.\n\nElle s'applique \u00e9galement, m\u00eame si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait conna\u00eetre l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un tel dommage. Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilit\u00e9 pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion ci-dessus ne s'appliquera pas \u00e0 votre \u00e9gard.\n\nEFFET JURIDIQUE. Le pr\u00e9sent contrat d\u00e9crit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d'autres droits pr\u00e9vus par les lois de votre pays. Le pr\u00e9sent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous conf\u00e8rent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas."
