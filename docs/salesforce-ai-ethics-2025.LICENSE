Ethics disclaimer for Salesforce AI models, data, code

This release is for research purposes only in support of an academic
paper. Our models, datasets, and code are not specifically designed or
evaluated for all downstream purposes. We strongly recommend users
evaluate and address potential concerns related to accuracy, safety, and
fairness before deploying this model. We encourage users to consider the
common limitations of AI, comply with applicable laws, and leverage best
practices when selecting use cases, particularly for high-risk scenarios
where errors or misuse could significantly impact peopleâ€™s lives, rights,
or safety. For further guidance on use cases, refer to our standard
[AUP](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/policies/ExternalFacing_Services_Policy.pdf)
and [AI AUP](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/policies/ai-acceptable-use-policy.pdf).
