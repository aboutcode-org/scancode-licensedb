Changes are permissible only\nif the modified file is given a new name, different from the names of\nexisting files in the MMIXware package,\nand only if the modified file is clearly identified\nas not being part of that package.\n(The CWEB system has a ``change file'' facility by\nwhich users can easily make minor alterations without modifying\nthe master source files in any way. Everybody is supposed to use\nchange files instead of changing the files.)\nThe author has tried his best to produce correct and useful programs,\nin order to help promote computer science research,\nbut no warranty of any kind should be assumed."
