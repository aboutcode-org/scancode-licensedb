except under a written agreement with terms and conditions at least as

Information shall not be considered Confidential Information if and to the 
extent that it: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or

Licensee, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as proven by the 
files of Licensee in existence at the time of disclosure; or (iii) becomes

of Broadcom&#39;s rights. 
 
5.2.	Return of Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all 
documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Broadcom 
Confidential Information and all copies thereof which are in the possession

SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING 
ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 
 
7.	MISCELLANEOUS 
 
7.1.	Export Regulations. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS

TO CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED. 
 
7.2	Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided, 
however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or 
obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or

attempted assignment shall be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee 
may assign this Agreement to a successor to all or substantially all of its 
business or assets to which this Agreement relates that is not a competitor

7.3.	Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of 
California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby 
excluded.  The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject 
matter hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of 
Orange, California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and 
venue. 
 
7.4.	Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if 
possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event 
any term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent 
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability 
of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or 
unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this 
Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the 
intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become 
terminated. 
 
7.5.	Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this 
Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom 
that may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be 
inadequate.  Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right 
to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under 
the Agreement in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.  
 
7.6.	Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default 
hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach 
or default. 
 
7.7.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement 
between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements 
and representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the 
Software.  This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the 
parties in writing.</code></pre>
