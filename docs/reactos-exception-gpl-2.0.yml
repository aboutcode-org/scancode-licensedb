  ReactOS may be used, runtime linked, and distributed with non-free software
  (meaning that such software has no obligations to open-source, or render
  free, their non-free code) such as commercial device drivers and commercial
  applications. This exception does not alter any other responsibilities of
  the licensee under the GPL (meaning that such software must still obey
  the GPL for the free ("open-sourced") code that has been integrated into
  the said software).
