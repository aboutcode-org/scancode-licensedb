Microsoft may decide to revoke the software\u2019s ability to consume PlayReady-protected content for reasons including but not limited to (i) if a breach or potential breach of PlayReady technology occurs, (ii) proactive robustness enhancement, and (iii) if Content owners require the revocation because the software fails to properly enforce restrictions on content usage.  Revocation should not affect unprotected content or content protected by other content access technologies.  Content owners may require you to upgrade PlayReady to access their content.  If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade and may not be able to install other operating system updates or upgrades.  \n            vii. Package Managers. The software may include package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use with your application. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.\n            viii. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content. \n           ix. Notice about the H.264/AVD Visual Standard, and the VC-1 Video Standard. This software may include H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VD-1 decoding technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice: \n\n        THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC AND THE VC-1 PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (\u201cVIDEO STANDARDS\u201d) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, AND VC-1 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO.

The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists using the Internet, when available.\n                \u2022 Windows Application Certification Kit. To ensure you have the latest certification tests, when launched this software periodically checks a Windows Application Certification Kit file on download.microsft.com to see if an update is available.  If an update is found, you are prompted and provided a link to a web site where you can download the update. You may use the Windows Application Certification Kit solely to test your programs before you submit them for a potential Microsoft Windows Certification and for inclusion on the Microsoft Windows Store. The results you receive are for informational purposes only. Microsoft has no obligation to either (i) provide you with a Windows Certification for your programs and/or ii) include your program in the Microsoft Windows Store.  \n                \u2022 Microsoft Digital Rights Management for Silverlight. \n                \u2022 If you use Silverlight to access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM), in order to let you play the content, the software may automatically\n                \u2022 request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet and\n                \u2022 download and install available DRM Updates.\n                \u2022 For more information about this feature, including instructions for turning the Automatic Updates off, go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=147032.\n                1. Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where you installed the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance, help and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.\n            ii. Use of Information. We may use  nformation collected about software use and performance to provide and improve Microsoft software and services as further described in Microsoft\u2019s Privacy Statement available at: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521839. We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.\n            iii. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else\u2019s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means. \n\n    4. YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS.\n\n        a.
