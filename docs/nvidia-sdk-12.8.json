License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits\uf0c1\n\nImportant Notice\u2014Read before downloading, installing, copying or using the licensed software:\n\nThis license agreement, including exhibits attached (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation (\u201cNVIDIA\u201d) and governs your use of a NVIDIA software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d).\n\nEach SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description of the types of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API input/output files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and documentation.\n\nThis Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.\n\nIf you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case \u201cyou\u201d will mean the entity you represent.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don\u2019t accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the SDK.\n\nYou agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.\n1.1. License\uf0c1\n1.1.1. License Grant\uf0c1\n\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this Agreement) to:\n\n    Install and use the SDK,\n\n    Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the SDK, and\n\n    Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application that meets the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.\n\n1.1.2. Distribution Requirements\uf0c1\n\nThese are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:\n\n    Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.\n\n    The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your application.\n\n    The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works of sample source code distributed: \u201cThis software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.\u201d\n\n    Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use only.\n\n    The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA\u2019s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.\n\n    You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.\n\n1.1.3. Authorized Users\uf0c1\n\nYou may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf.\n\nIf you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.\n\nYou are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that your authorized users didn\u2019t follow the terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.\n\n1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK\uf0c1\n\nThe SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.\n\nYou may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.\n\nNVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.\n\n1.1.5. Updates\uf0c1\n\nNVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.\n\n1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses\uf0c1\n\nThe SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with separate legal notices or terms as may be described in proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the license terms associated with the component, the license terms associated with the components control only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.\n\nSubject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the SDK to develop and test applications released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software licenses.\n\n1.1.7. Reservation of Rights\uf0c1\n\nNVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.\n\n1.2. Limitations\uf0c1\n\nThe following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:\n\n    You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.\n\n    Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the SDK as a stand-alone product.\n\n    Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not indicate that an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.\n\n    You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in the SDK.\n\n    You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open source software license.
