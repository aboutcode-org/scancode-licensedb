  \ is provided \"as is,\" with all faults, defects and errors, and without warranty of any\
  \ kind. Gitleaks LLC does not warrant that the Software will be free of bugs, errors, viruses\
  \ or other defects, and Gitleaks LLC shall have no liability of any kind for the use of or\
  \ inability to use the Software, the Software content or any associated service, and you acknowledge\
  \ that it is not technically practicable for Gitleaks LLC to do so. \nTo the maximum extent\
  \ permitted by applicable law, Gitleaks LLC disclaims all warranties, express, implied, arising\
  \ by law or otherwise, regarding the Software, the Software content and their respective performance\
  \ or suitability for your intended use, including without limitation any implied warranty\
  \ of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. \n\
  \nIn no event will Gitleaks LLC be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental,\
  \ special, exemplary, or punitive damages or liabilities whatsoever arising from or relating\

  \ (including negligence), strict liability or other theory, even if Gitleaks LLC has been\
  \ advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\nIn no event will Gitleaks LLC's liability\
  \ exceed the Software license price as indicated in the invoice. The existence of more than\
  \ one claim will not enlarge or extend this limit.\n\n9. Remedies. Your exclusive remedy and\
  \ Gitleaks LLC's entire liability for breach of this Agreement shall be limited, at Gitleaks\
  \ LLC's sole and exclusive discretion, to\n  (a) replacement of any defective software or\

  \ Data. You agree that Gitleaks LLC and its affiliates may collect and use technical information\
  \ gathered as part of the product support services. Gitleaks LLC may use this information\
  \ solely to improve products and services and will not disclose this information in a form\
  \ that personally identifies you.\n\n10.2 Verification. Gitleaks LLC or a certified auditor\
  \ acting on our behalf, may, upon our reasonable request and at our expense, audit you with\
  \ respect to the use of the Software. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means\

  \ be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities and shall not unreasonably\
  \ interfere with your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any\
  \ electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that you are using\
  \ the Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the EULA, then you shall\
  \ pay our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, you\
  \ agree to pay us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the\
  \ alternative, we reserve the right, at our sole option, to terminate the licenses for the\
  \ Software.\n\n10.3 Government End Users. If the Software and related documentation are supplied\
  \ to or purchased by or on behalf of the United States Government, then the Software is deemed\
  \ to be \"commercial software\" as that term is used in the Federal Acquisition Regulation\
  \ system. Rights of the United States shall not exceed the minimum rights set forth in FAR\
  \ 52.227-19 for \"restricted computer software\". All other terms and conditions of this Agreement\
  \ apply.\n\n11. Third Party Software. Examples included in Software may provide links to third\
  \ party libraries or code (collectively “Third Party Software”) to implement various functions.\
  \ Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Software. In some cases, access to Third\
  \ Party Software may be included along with the Software delivery as a convenience for demonstration\
  \ purposes. Licensee acknowledges:\n  (1) that some part of Third Party Software may require\
  \ additional licensing of copyright and patents from the owners of such, and\n  (2) that distribution\
  \ of any of the Software referencing or including any portion of a Third Party Software may\
  \ require appropriate licensing from such third parties.\n\n12. Miscellaneous\n\n12.1 Entire\
