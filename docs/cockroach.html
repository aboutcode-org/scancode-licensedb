or modify such Work so that it becomes non-infringing without substantially

and hold Cockroach Labs harmless against any Losses arising from any such claim

by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts), and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shall Licensor or
any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any amounts in excess, in the
aggregate, of the fees paid by You to Cockroach Labs under this Agreement in the
twelve (12) months preceding the date the first cause of liability arose), or

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

Derivative Works thereof, and without limiting your obligations under Section 6,
You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License.However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,

other Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.
