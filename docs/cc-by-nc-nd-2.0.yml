  \ the Uniform Resource\nIdentifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with\
  \ the\nWork, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or\nlicensing information\
  \ for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in\nany reasonable manner; provided, however,\
  \ that in the case of a\nCollective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n\

  \ Work, subject to the compulsory\nlicense created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright\
  \ Act (or the\nequivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance\nis\
  \ primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or\nprivate monetary compensation.\n\
  \n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE\
  \ PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES\
  \ OF ANY\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUDING,\

  \ the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\nWork under different license terms\
  \ or to stop distributing the Work at\nany time; provided, however that any such election\
  \ will not serve to\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\nrequired\
  \ to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full\
  \ force and effect unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\nEach time You\
  \ distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a\nCollective Work, the Licensor offers\
  \ to the recipient a license to the\nWork on the same terms and conditions as the license\
  \ granted to You\nunder this License.\n\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\
  \ under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder\
  \ of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties to this agreement,\
  \ such provision shall be reformed to\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision\
  \ valid and\nenforceable.\n\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\
  \ no\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\nand signed by\
  \ the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\nThis License constitutes the entire\
