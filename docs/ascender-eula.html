Note: Click here for more information on various font license options, including multi-workstation licenses, enterprise-wide licenses, and application server licenses.

This Ascender Corporation End User Agreement (the &#34;Agreement&#34;) becomes a binding contract between you and Ascender Corporation when you click on the area marked &#34;OK&#34; or &#34;I Accept.&#34; If you do not wish to be bound by the Agreement, you cannot access, use or download the Font Software. Please read all of the Agreement before you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.

You hereby agree to the following:

1. You are bound by the Agreement and you acknowledge that all Use (as defined herein) of the Font Software (as defined herein) supplied to you by Ascender is governed by the Agreement.

2. &#34;Ascender&#34; as used herein shall mean collectively Ascender Corporation, its authorized distributors and suppliers.

3. &#34;Font Software&#34; as used herein shall mean software which, when used on an appropriate device, generates the typefaces. Font Software includes all bitmap representations of the typeface designs. Font Software includes permitted copies, and related documentation.

4. &#34;Licensed Computers&#34; as used herein shall mean five (5) personal computers, unless you specifically purchased the right from Ascender to use the Font Software on more than five (5) personal computers. If you intend to use the Font Software on more than five (5) personal computers, you may obtain a license from Ascender (or its authorized distributor) for an additional fee. Your receipt will serve as your record of the number of personal computers for which you are licensed to use the Font Software.

5. &#34;Use&#34; of the Font Software shall occur when an individual is able to give commands (whether by keyboard or otherwise) that are followed by the Font Software, regardless of the location in which the Font Software resides.

6. &#34;Personal or Internal Business Use&#34; shall mean Use of the Font Software for your customary personal or internal business purposes and shall not mean any distribution whatsoever of the Font Software. &#34;Personal or Internal Business Use&#34; shall not include any Use of the Font Software by persons that are not members of your immediate household, your authorized employees, or your authorized agents.

7. &#34;Commercial Product&#34; as used herein shall mean an electronic document or data file created by Use of the Font Software which is offered for distribution as a commercial product in exchange for a separate fee or other consideration.

8. You are hereby granted a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable (except as expressly permitted herein) license to access the Font Software (i) only in a Licensed Computer, (ii) only for your Personal or Internal Business Use, and (iii) only subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

The Font Software may not be installed or Used on a server that can be accessed via the Internet or other external network system (a system other than a LAN) by personal computers which are not Licensed Computers, unless you acquire a license from Ascender granting you this specific right.

10. You may electronically distribute Font Software embedded in a &#34;Personal or Internal Business Use&#34; document (that is, a document other than a &#34;Commercial Product&#34; as defined herein) only when the Font Software embedded in such document is distributed in a secure format that permits only the viewing, printing and editing (and not the installing) of such Font Software.

You agree to use trademarks associated with the Font Software according to accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner&#39;s name.

IN NO EVENT WILL ASCENDER BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE (I) FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF ASCENDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (II) FOR ANY CLAIM AGAINST YOU BY ANY THIRD PARTY SEEKING SUCH DAMAGES EVEN IF ASCENDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusions of limitations of incidental, consequential or special damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Also, some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusions of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To the greatest extent permitted by law, any implied warranties not effectively excluded by the Agreement are limited to ninety (90) days. Some jurisdictions do not permit a limitation of implied warranties where the product results in physical injury or death so that such limitations may not apply to you. In those jurisdictions, you agree that Ascender&#39;s liability for such physical injury or death shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars (U.S. $100,000), provided that such jurisdictions permit a limitation of such liability. This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary from state to state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Font Software is nonreturnable and nonrefundable.

15. The Agreement will be governed by the laws of Illinois applicable to contracts wholly entered and performable within such state.

Both you and Ascender agree to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts in any action related to the Agreement. The Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.

16. The Agreement shall automatically terminate upon failure by you (or any authorized person or member of your immediate household to whom you have given permission to Use the Font Software) to comply with its terms. The termination of the Agreement shall not preclude Ascender from suing you for damages of any breach of the Agreement.
