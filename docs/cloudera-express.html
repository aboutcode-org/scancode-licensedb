12. Reporting. Customer acknowledges that the product contains a diagnostic functionality as its default configuration. The diagnostic function collects configuration files, node count, software versions, log files and other information regarding your environment, and reports that information to Cloudera in order for Cloudera to proactively diagnose any potential issues in the product. The diagnostic function may be modified by Customer in order to disable regular automatic reporting or to report only on filing of a support ticket.

13. Termination. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues unless terminated for Customer&#39;s breach of any material term herein. Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of a breach of Sections 3, 4 or 6, Cloudera may immediately terminate this Agreement. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (a) all rights granted to Customer under this Agreement will immediately cease; and (b) Customer will promptly provide Cloudera with all Confidential Information (including, but not limited to the Products) then in its possession or destroy all copies of such Confidential Information, at Cloudera&#39;s sole discretion and direction. Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in this Agreement, this sentence and the following Sections will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 15.

14. In the event that Customer uses the functionality in the Product for the purposes of downloading and installing any Cloudera-provided public beta software, such beta software will be subject either to the Apache 2 license, or to the terms and conditions of the Public Beta License located here: (http://ccp.cloudera.com/display/SUPPORT/CLOUDERA+PUBLIC+BETA+AGREEMENT) as applicable.

15. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. The parties agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, and the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Agy. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled. Except for payments due under this Agreement, neither party will be responsible for any failure to perform or delay attributable in whole or in part to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God (fire, storm, floods, earthquakes, etc.), civil disturbances, disruption of telecommunications, disruption of power or other essential services, interruption or termination of service by any service providers being used by Cloudera to link its servers to the Internet, labor disturbances, vandalism, cable cut, computer viruses or other similar occurrences, or any malicious or unlawful acts of any third-party (each a &#34;Force Majeure Event&#34;). In the event of any such delay the date of delivery will be deferred for a period equal to the time lost by reason of the delay. Any notice or communication required or permitted to be given hereunder must be in writing signed or authorized by the party giving notice, and may be delivered by hand, deposited with an overnight courier, sent by confirmed email, confirmed facsimile or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case to the address below or at such other address as may hereafter be furnished in accordance with this Section. No modification, addition or deletion, or waiver of any rights under this Agreement will be binding on a party unless made in an agreement clearly understood by the parties to be a modification or waiver and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party. No failure or delay (in whole or in part) on the part of a party to exercise any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof or effect any other right or remedy. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided hereunder or by law. The waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.</code></pre>
