HP WARRANTY STATEMENT

DURATION OF LIMITED WARRANTY: 90 DAYS

HP warrants to you, the end customer, that HP hardware, accessories, and
supplies will be free from defects in materials and workmanship after the date
of purchase for the period specified above.  If HP receives notice of such
defects during the warranty period, HP will, at its option, either repair or
replace products which prove to be defective.  Replacement products may be
either new or equivalent in performance to new.

HP warrants to you that HP Software will not fail to execute its programming
instructions after the date of purchase, for the period specified above, due
to defects in materials and workmanship when properly installed and used.  If
HP receives notice of such defects during the warranty period, HP will replace
Software which does not execute its programming instructions due to such
defects.

HP does not warrant that the operation of HP products will be uninterrupted or
error free.  If HP is unable, within a reasonable time, to repair or replace
any product to a condition warranted, you will be entitled to a refund of the
purchase price upon prompt return of the product.  Alternatively, in the case
of HP Software, you will be entitled to a refund of the purchase price upon
prompt delivery to HP of written notice from you confirming destruction of the
HP Software, together with all copies, adaptations, and merged portions in any
form.

HP products may contain remanufactured parts equivalent to new in performance
or may have been subject to incidental use.

Warranty does not apply to defects resulting from: (a) improper or inadequate
maintenance or calibration; (b) software, interfacing, parts or supplies not
supplied by HP, (c) unauthorized modification or misuse; (d) operation outside
of the published environmental specifications for the product, (e) improper
site preparation or maintenance, or (f) the presence of code from HP suppliers
embedded in or bundled with any HP product.

TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LOCAL LAW, THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUSIVE AND NO
OTHER WARRANTY OR CONDITION, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED
AND HP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Some countries, states, or provinces do not allow limitations on the duration
of an implied warranty, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you might also have
other rights that vary from country to country, state to state, or province to
province.

TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LOCAL LAW, THE REMEDIES IN THIS WARRANTY STATEMENT
ARE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES.  EXCEPT AS INDICATED ABOVE, IN NO EVENT
WILL HP OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF DATA OR FOR DIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFIT OR DATA), OR OTHER DAMAGE,
WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.  Some countries, states, or
provinces do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</code></pre>
