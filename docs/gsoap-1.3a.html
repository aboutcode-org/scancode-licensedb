        (a)
            under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display,
            perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions
            thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger
            Work; and
        (b)
            under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
            Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (&#34;offer to sell and
            import&#34;) the Original Code, Modifications, or portions thereof, but
            solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary
            to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with other
            software, the Original Code, Modifications, or any combination or
            portions thereof.
        (c)
        (d)

  2.2. Contributor Grant.

      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor

            under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,
            to make, have made, use and sell (&#34;offer to sell and import&#34;) the
            Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent
            that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
            utilize, alone or in combination with other software, the
            Contributor Version (or portions thereof).
        (c)
        (d)
***** 3 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. *****
  3.1. Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
      only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
      released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
      with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
      impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
      applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder.
      However, You may include an additional document offering the additional
      rights described in Section 3.5.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer
      in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License.

  3.3. Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
        (a) Third Party Claims.
            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s
            intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
            granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
            must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
            &#34;LEGAL&#34; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
            sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
            Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
            available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
            modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
            thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
            appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
            inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
            been obtained.
        (b) Contributor APIs.
            If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming
            interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
            are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
            also include this information in the LEGAL file.
        (c) Representations.
            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
            Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s
            Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or
            Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
            this License.

  3.5. Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
      look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
      may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
      You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
      Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating
      to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
      recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
      behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable
      versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce
      the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials
      provided with the product.

  3.7. Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
      as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

  3.8. Restrictions.

      You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary
      notices or labels from gSOAP.
***** 4 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. *****
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.
***** 5 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. *****
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
***** 6 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. *****
  6.1. New Versions.

      Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
      to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

  6.2. Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License.

  6.3. Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrase &#34;gSOAP&#34; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
      license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and
      (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains
      terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of
      the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
      described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

***** 8 TERMINATION. *****
  8.1.
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
      any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
  8.2.
  8.3.
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.
  8.4.
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
