text: "Siesta ACADEMIC LICENCE for INDIVIDUALS\n\nMotivation and Preamble\n\nThe Siesta program\
  \ has been devised for its general use in research\nwithin the academic community. Some conditions\
  \ have been defined for\nthe use, distribution, and modification of Siesta, which the authors\n\
  consider fair and within the common fair practices in the academic\ncommunity.\n\n1. Definitions\n\
  \n\"The Authors\" are:\n\n    * Emilio Artacho, University of Cambridge, and IkerBasque and\n\
  \    CIC-Nanogune, San Sebastián * José María Cela,\n    Barcelona Supercomputing Center *\
  \ Julian Gale, Curtin University\n    of Technology, Perth * Alberto García, ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona\
  \ *\n    Javier Junquera, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander * Pablo\n    Ordejón, CIN2-CSIC,\
  \ Barcelona * Daniel Sánchez-Portal, Centro\n    de Física de Materiales, CSIC-UPV/EHU, San\
  \ Sebastián * \n    José M. Soler, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid\n\nAlthough we, the Authors,\
  \ acknowledge that a limited number of\nauxiliary subroutines were written by (or are based\
  \ on previous\nsubroutines written by) other authors consider that the implementation\nof\
  \ all the basic algorithms of the Siesta program is ours.\n\nThe Siesta team (\"the Developers\"\
  ) are the Authors and:\n\n    * Richard M. Martin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\
  \n\"The Copyright-Holder\" is the set of Authors.\n\nThe valid distributors of the Siesta\
  \ package (\"The Distributors\") are\nthe Developers as specified above.\n\n\"The Siesta package\"\
  \ is the suite of software, including the Siesta\ncode itself, but also all other software,\
  \ documentation, scripts, and\nancillary support material distributed as a single entity.\
  \ This\nLicence covers the entirety of said data.\n\nThe Licensee is the person (never an\
  \ institution) to whom the Siesta\npackage is distributed (under the terms of this Licence)\
  \ by the\nDistributors; they are bound by this agreement.\n\n2. NO WARRANTY\n\nThere is no\
  \ warranty for any part of the Siesta package. The Siesta\npackage is provided by the Distributors\
  \ \"as-is\" without warranty of\nany kind, either express or implied, including but not limited\
  \ to the\nimplied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular\npurpose. In no\
  \ event shall the Distributors be liable for any direct,\nindirect, incidental, special, exemplary,\
  \ or consequential damages\n(including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods\
  \ or\nservices; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption)\nhowever caused and\
  \ on any theory of liability, whether in contract,\nstrict liability, or tort (including negligence\
  \ or otherwise) arising\nin any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the\n\
  possibility of such damage. The entire risk as to the quality or\nperformance of the program,\
  \ or any action the Licensee may take based\non the output of any part of the Siesta package,\
  \ is with the Licensee.\n\n3. Limitation of Usage\n\nThe use of the Siesta package under the\
  \ present Licence is restricted\nsolely to members of academic institutions (including universities\
  \ and\nnon-military public research laboratories) and to academic purposes,\ni.e., leading\
  \ to open publication of results, with neither withhold of\ninformation nor intentional delay\
  \ in publication. Notwithstanding\nthese general definitions, the Authors reserve the exclusive\
  \ right to\ndetermine what purposes and persons are elegible for using the\nSiesta package\
  \ under this Licence, and to withhold the right to use\nthe software where they are not satisfied\
  \ that either condition is\nfulfilled.\n\nThe Licensee is hereby provided with a non-exclusive,\
  \ royalty-free\nright to use any part of the Siesta package, and to display, publish,\nperform,\
  \ or otherwise use results obtained by use of the Siesta\npackage in any form, subject to\
  \ the restriction that in any paper or\nother academic publication containing results wholly\
  \ or partially\nderived from the results of use of the Siesta package, the following\npapers\
  \ must be cited in the normal manner:\n\n   1. Self-consistent order-N density-functional\
  \ calculations for very\n   large systems, P. Ordejón, E. Artacho and J. M. Soler, Phys. Rev.\
  \ B\n   (Rapid Comm.) 53, R10441 (1996).  \n   \n   2. The Siesta method for ab initio order-N\
  \ materials simulation,\n   José M. Soler, Emilio Artacho, Julian D. Gale, Alberto García,\n\
  \   Javier Junquera, Pablo Ordejón and Daniel Sánchez-Portal, J. Phys.:\n   Condens. Matter\
  \ 14, 2745 (2002).\n\nOther papers relevant to the Siesta package and method should be cited\n\
  as best scientific practice dictates.\n\nLicensees are recommended to send reference to the\
  \ Developers of any\npublication containing results wholly or partially derived from the\n\
  results of use of the Siesta package.\n\nThe above-mentioned right to use the code is extensive\
  \ to the members\nof the research group of the Licensee as long as the use is in\ncollaboration\
  \ with the Licensee leading to co-authored publication(s).\n\n4. Support\n\nThe present Licence\
  \ does not imply support services of any kind to the\nLicensee by the Distributors, including,\
  \ but not limited to,\ninstallation, compilation and use of the software in the package.\n\
  \n5. Modification\n\nLicensees are permitted to modify Siesta for their own private use; in\n\
  any paper containing results wholly or partially derived from the use\nof a modified version\
  \ of Siesta, the authors are required to state\nthat a privately modified version of Siesta\
  \ is used, and satisfy the\nconditions of use stated above.\n\nThe Developers encourage Licensees\
  \ to submit their modifications of\nthe Siesta package to them, so that the Siesta package\
  \ does not fork,\nand furthermore so that the package can be improved for all\nusers. Licensees\
  \ can thereby benefit from the ulterior developments of\nSiesta.\n\nTo this end, the Developers\
  \ wish to encourage Licensees to make any\nmodifications to the Siesta package in as modular\
  \ a fashion as\npossible: for example, interacting via files, or via well-defined\ninterface\
  \ calls. This permits maintenance of these modifications as a\nseparate entity in many cases,\
  \ and may allow their separation from\nSiesta and distribution as a separate piece of software:\
  \ in that case,\nsuch software is not subject to this Licence, and the authors of the\nseparate\
  \ software are free to choose any licensing terms they desire.\n\nHowever, if a given modification\
  \ must be incorporated directly into\nthe Siesta package, the author(s) of any such modifications\
  \ must\nprovide a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable license to the \nCopyright-Holder,\
  \ to further modify their modifications \n(\"the Contributed Code\") as may prove necessary\
  \ for the\nfuture development of Siesta, and to distribute the Contributed Code\n(in its original\
  \ or any later modified form) as part of the Siesta\npackage.\n\nThe Developers, in the interests\
  \ of maintaining the efficiency of the\nSiesta package and the modularity of its code base,\
  \ actively encourage\nall those considering modifications to the Siesta package to discuss\n\
  their planned modifications with the Developers beforehand.\n\n6. Redistribution\n\nThe authors\
  \ reserve the exclusive right to distribute the Siesta\npackage. Licensees have no right to\
  \ distribute the Siesta package, a\nmodified or alternative version thereof, or any other\
  \ program making\ndirect use of parts of the Siesta package, without the prior written\nconsent\
  \ of the Distributors.\n\n7. All Other Rights\n\nAll other rights not explicitly mentioned\
  \ in this document are\nreserved. In particular, the Authors reserve all rights to resolve\
  \ any\nand all conflicts arising in the development and distribution policies\nof the Siesta\
  \ package.\n\nWithout accepting the Licence, a prospective Licensee does not have the\nright\
  \ to use or modify the Siesta package.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
  \ copies of this\nLicence document, but changing it is not permitted."
