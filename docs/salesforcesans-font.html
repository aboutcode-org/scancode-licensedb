THIS FONT LICENSE AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND
SALESFORCE.COM, INC. (“WE”, “US”, “OUR”, AND “SALESFORCE”) THAT GOVERNS YOUR
ACQUISITION AND USE OF THE SALESFORCE SANS FONT (E.G., TYPEFACE, TYPOGRAPHIC
CHARACTERS, ALPHANUMERICS, SYMBOLS, DESIGNS, AND ORNAMENTS) AND THE RELATED
FONT FILES (E.G., TRUETYPE (TTF), WEB OPEN FONT FORMAT (WOFF,WOFF2), EMBEDDED
OPENTYPE (EOT), AND SCALABLE VECTOR GRAPHICS (SVG) FILES) (COLLECTIVELY, THE
“FONT”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE FONT, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT.  IF YOU ARE DOWNLOADING OR USING THE FONT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR
OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH
ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR
“YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH
AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST
NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE FONT. This Agreement was last updated on August 21,
2015.  It is effective between You and Us as of the date You accept this
Agreement by downloading or using the Font.

1. License Grant
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any other
applicable Salesforce terms, conditions, and acceptable use policies (AUPs),
We hereby grant to You a revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, and non-
sublicenseable limited license to, without modification, reproduce and use the
Font solely to create applications with the Salesforce Lightning Design System
that run in Salesforce or on a Salesforce platform (e.g., Lightning, Heroku,
Visualforce) (“Applications”).

2. Restrictions
To the extent your Application contains copyright notices,
together with all other copyright notices included with each Application, You
will include the following copyright notice: “The Salesforce Sans Font is used
under license from salesforce.com, inc.  Copyright 2015 Salesforce.com, Inc.”
You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile,
disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Font.  You must include
the Font in an Application in a manner that does not allow a user to access
the Font outside of the Application.  You will not use the Font on a
standalone basis and will only use the Font as part of the Salesforce
Lightning Design System.  You must not take any action which will have the
direct or indirect effect of causing the Font to become subject to the terms
of an open source license or any similar terms.  You may refer to the Font as
“Salesforce Sans”, but You may not use any other Salesforce trademark in
connection with the Font except as may be expressly agreed to by Salesforce in
writing or as set forth in other applicable Salesforce terms, conditions, and
acceptable use policies (AUPs) and in any event You must comply at all times
with the Salesforce Trademark and Copyright Usage Guidelines located at http:/
/www2.sfdcstatic.com/assets/pdf/misc/salesforce_Trademark_Usage_Guidelines.pdf
and any other supplemental guidelines that may apply to you.  You must not
license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute,
time share, or otherwise commercially exploit the Font nor make the Font
available to any third party, other than as expressly permitted by this
Agreement.  To the extent any Font documentation, style guides, or other
applicable Salesforce terms, conditions, and acceptable use policies (AUPs)
impose guidelines or restrictions for the use of the Font, You will abide by
those guidelines and restrictions.

3. Ownership
Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, We
reserve all rights, title, and interest in and to the Font, including all
related intellectual property rights.  No rights are granted to You hereunder
other than as expressly set forth herein.  We shall have a royalty-free,
worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license to use and incorporate into the Font
any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, or other feedback
provided by You.

4. Term and Termination
This Agreement will take effect when you download or
use the Font and will terminate upon the earlier of:  (a) Your failure to
comply with any term of this Agreement or any other applicable Salesforce
terms, conditions, and acceptable use policies (AUPs); (b) return,
destruction, or deletion of all copies of the Font in your possession; or, (c)
60 days after Salesforce provides You with written notice of termination.
Salesforce’s rights and your obligations will survive the termination of this
Agreement.  Upon termination of this Agreement by Salesforce, if requested by
Salesforce, you will destroy or delete all copies of the Font in your
possession and cease using the Font in all Applications.

5. No Warranty
THE FONT IS PROVIDED “AS-IS,” EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY
WHATSOEVER.  WE DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  The Font may contain bugs or errors.  Any use of
the Font is at Your sole risk.  You acknowledge that We may discontinue making
the Font available to You at any time in Our sole discretion.

6. No Damages
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY HEREUNDER TO YOU FOR
ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES BASED ON
LOST PROFITS, DATA OR USE, HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. General Provisions
You may not assign any of Your rights or obligations
hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without Our prior written
consent.  This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the internal laws of
the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules.  Each
party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located in San Francisco County, California to adjudicate any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral,
concerning its subject matter.  No modification, amendment, or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and either
signed or accepted electronically by the party against whom the modification,
amendment or waiver is to be asserted.</code></pre>
