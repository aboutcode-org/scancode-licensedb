text: "****** SKIP - The System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns ******\n \n***** Introduction\
  \ *****\n \nThe System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns (SKIP) system for\n ordering kanji was\
  \ developed by Jack Halpern and used as the\n main index for kanji in the New Japanese-English\
  \ Character\n Dictionary (Kenkyusha/NTC, 1990) and The Kodansha Kanji\n Learner's Dictionary\
  \ (Kodansha, 1999) and other dictionaries\n published by Kanji Dictionary Publishing Society.\n\
  \ \nThe SKIP codes for the kanji not in the NJECD were compiled by\n Jack Halpern and Martin\
  \ Duerst (the remaining kanji in JIS X\n 0208) and Jim Breen (the 5,801 kanji in JIS X 0212).\n\
  \ An overview of the SKIP system is available at this page.\n\n ***** Conditions Of Use *****\n\
