This guarantees your   * \n * right to use, modify, and redistribute this software under certain      * \n * conditions.  If you wish to embed DRAKVUF technology into proprietary   *\n * software, alternative licenses can be acquired from the author.         *\n *                                                                         *\n * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on \"derivative works\",  *\n * yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid   *\n * misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law   *\n * allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a        *\n * derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the   *\n * following with any software or content covered by this license          *\n * (\"Covered Software\"):                                                   *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Reads or includes copyrighted data files.                             *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *\n * results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will *\n * execute anything you tell them to).                                     *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *\n * installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including *\n * DRAKVUF with other software in compressed or archival form does not     *\n * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *\n * or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    *\n * purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered *\n * Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  *\n * another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       *\n * Internet).                                                              *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the  *\n * above.                                                                  *\n *                                                                         *\n * o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  *\n *                                                                         *\n * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *\n * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *\n * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *\n * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *\n * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *\n * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *\n * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *\n *                                                                         *\n * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *\n * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *\n * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *\n * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *\n * allowed.  All GPL references to \"this License\", are to be treated as    *\n * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *\n *                                                                         *\n * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *\n * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *\n * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *\n * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *\n * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *\n * DRAKVUF or grant special permissions to use it in other open source     *\n * software.  Please contact tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com with any such       *\n * requests.  Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source     *\n * software into Covered Software without special permission from the      *\n * copyright holders.                                                      *\n *                                                                         *\n * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *\n * DRAKVUF in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above,         *\n * alternative license can be requested from the author to integrate       *\n * DRAKVUF into proprietary applications and appliances.  Please email     *\n * tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com for further information.                      *\n *                                                                         *\n * If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        *\n * Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  *\n * and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   *\n *                                                                         *\n * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *\n * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *\n * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.          *\n *                                                                         *\n * Source code also allows you to port DRAKVUF to new platforms, fix bugs, *\n * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to submit your changes *\n * on https://github.com/tklengyel/drakvuf, or by other methods.           *\n * By sending these changes, it is understood (unless you specify          *\n * otherwise) that you are offering unlimited, non-exclusive right to      *\n * reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  DRAKVUF will always be          *\n * available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to   *\n * relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software  *\n * projects (such as KDE and NASM).                                        *\n * To specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say   *\n * so when you send them.                                                  *\n *                                                                         *\n * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but     *\n * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of              *\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the DRAKVUF   *\n * license file for more details (it's in a COPYING file included with     *\n * DRAKVUF, and also available from                                        *\n * https://github.com/tklengyel/drakvuf/COPYING)                           *\n *                                                                         *\n ***************************************************************************/"
