  \n\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the\nterms\
  \ of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code\nversion of Covered\
  \ Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of\
  \ this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include\na copy of this License with\
  \ every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not\noffer or impose any terms on\
  \ any Source Code version that alters or restricts the\napplicable version of this License\
  \ or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You\nmay include an additional document offering\
  \ the additional rights described in\nSection 3.5.\n\n3.2 Availability of Source Code.\n\n\
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available\nin Source\
  \ Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an\nExecutable version\
  \ or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to\nwhom you made an Executable\
  \ version available; and if made available via Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain\
  \ available for at least twelve (12) months after\nthe date it initially became available,\
  \ or at least six (6) months after a subsequent\nversion of that particular Modification has\
  \ been made available to such recipients.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the Source\
  \ Code version remains available even\nif the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained\
  \ by a third party.\n\n3.3 Description of Modifications.\n\nYou must cause all Covered Software\
  \ to which You contribute to contain a file\ndocumenting the changes You made to create that\
  \ Covered Software and the date of any\nchange. You must include a prominent statement that\
  \ the Modification is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by\
  \ Nokia and including the\nname of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in\
  \ an Executable version\nor related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership\
  \ of the Covered\nSoftware.\n\n3.4  Intellectual Property Matters\n\n(a) Third Party Claims.\n\
  \nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual\nproperty\
  \ rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under\nSections 2.1\
  \ or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\ndistribution titled \"\
  LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim\nin sufficient detail that\
  \ a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor\nobtains such knowledge after the\
  \ Modification is made available as described in\nSection 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\
  \ modify the LEGAL file in all copies\nContributor makes available thereafter and shall take\
  \ other steps (such as notifying\nappropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\
  \ to inform those who\nreceived the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\
  \n(b) Contributor APIs.\n\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\
  \ interface and\nContributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary\
  \ to\nimplement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\
  \n(c) Representations.\n\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\
  \ 3.4(a) above,\nContributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original\n\
  creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\nthis\
  \ License.\n\n3.5 Required Notices.\n\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each\
  \ file of the Source Code. If it is\nnot possible to put such notice in a particular Source\
  \ Code file due to its\nstructure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as\
  \ a relevant\ndirectory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created\
  \ one\nor more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice\ndescribed\
  \ in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for\nthe Source\
  \ Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to\nCovered Software.\
  \ You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability\
  \ obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only\
  \ on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia\nor any Contributor. You must make it absolutely\
  \ clear that any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\
  \ You alone, and You hereby\nagree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability\
  \ incurred by Nokia or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability\
  \ terms You\noffer.\n\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\nYou may distribute Covered\
  \ Software in Executable form only if the requirements of\nSection 3.1-3.5 have been met for\
  \ that Covered Software, and if You include a notice\nstating that the Source Code version\
  \ of the Covered Software is available under the\nterms of this License, including a description\
  \ of how and where You have fulfilled\nthe obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\
  \ conspicuously included in any\nnotice in an Executable version, related documentation or\
  \ collateral in which You\ndescribe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You\
  \ may distribute the\nExecutable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license\
  \ of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You\
  \ are in\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable\n\
  version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code\nversion\
  \ from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable\nversion under\
  \ a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from\
  \ this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any\nContributor. You hereby agree\
  \ to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor\
  \ as a result of any such terms You\noffer.\n\n3.7 Larger Works.\n\nYou may create a Larger\
  \ Work by combining Covered Software with other software not\ngoverned by the terms of this\

  \ sure the requirements of this License are\nfulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. INABILITY\
  \ TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any\

  \ statute, judicial order, or\nregulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this\
  \ License to the maximum\nextent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\
  \ affect. Such\ndescription must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and\
  \ must be\nincluded with all distributions of the Source Code.\n\nExcept to the extent prohibited\
  \ by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient\
  \ of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nThis\
  \ License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and\nto related\
  \ Covered Software.\n\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\n\n\n6.1 New Versions.\n\nNokia may publish\
  \ revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\nversion will be given\
  \ a distinguishing version number.\n\n6.2 Effect of New Versions.\n\nOnce Covered Software\
  \ has been published under a particular version of the License,\nYou may always continue to\
  \ use it under the terms of that version. You may also\nchoose to use such Covered Software\
  \ under the terms of any subsequent version of the\nLicense published by Nokia. No one other\
  \ than Nokia has the right to modify the terms\napplicable to Covered Software created under\
  \ this License.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE\

  PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\nDEFECTIVE\
  \ IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER\nCONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME\
  \ THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS\nDISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY\
  \ CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\
  \ HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1 This License and the rights\
  \ granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You\nfail to comply with terms herein\
  \ and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\nbecoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses\
  \ to the Covered Software which are\nproperly granted shall survive any termination of this\
  \ License. Provisions which, by\ntheir nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination\
  \ of this License shall\nsurvive.\n\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent\
  \ infringement claim (excluding\ndeclatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor\
  \ (Nokia or Contributor\nagainst whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\"\
  ) alleging that:\n\na) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes\
  \ any\npatent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1\n\
  and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\nprospectively,\
  \ unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree\nin writing to pay\
  \ Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past\nand future use of Modifications\
  \ made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your\nlitigation claim with respect to the Contributor\
  \ Version against such Participant. If\nwithin 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and\
  \ payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation\
  \ claim is not\nwithdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\
  \ 2.2\nautomatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified\nabove.\n\
  \nb) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor\nVersion,\
  \ directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You\nby such Participant\
  \ under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the\ndate You first made, used,\
  \ sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\nParticipant.\n\n8.3 If You assert\
  \ a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such\nParticipant's Contributor\
  \ Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where\nsuch claim is resolved (such\
  \ as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\npatent infringement litigation,\
  \ then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by\nsuch Participant under Sections 2.1\
  \ or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining\nthe amount or value of any payment or\
  \ license.\n\n8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user\
  \ license\nagreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted\
  \ by\nYou or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n\
  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\
  \ (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,\
  \ OR ANY\nDISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\

  \ SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE\
  \ TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\nLIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\
  \ THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL\nOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY\
  \ TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A\nPARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY\
  \ SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S.\n$50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory\
  \ rights of any\nparty dealing as a consumer.\n\n10. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents\

  \ to it.\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law\n\
  provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled\nby a\
  \ single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The\narbitration\
