    "Ported Source Code" means a source program produced from the Source Code by modifying only its Hardware-dependent Part and/or Compiler-dependent Part to enable it to be operated on the T-Engine Hardware or the Similar Hardware to T-Engine Hardware. The Ported Source Code which is registered with T-Engine Forum shall be included in the Source Code.
    "Modified Source Code" means a source program modified from the Source Code for the purpose of improving its performance, increasing or decreasing its function, and the like. The Ported Source Code shall not be included in the Modified Source Code.

    "End User" means a consumer who uses the Embedded Product.
    "System Developer" means any person who develops the Embedded Product by itself or has a third party develop the same, and provides, whether with or without payment, the End User with the Embedded Product.
    "Distributor of Modification" means any person who produces the Modified Source Code and, whether with or without payment, distributes the same to any third party.
    "Patch for Modification" means a difference, program, system, or the like in order to create the Modified Source Code from the Source Code or the Binary Code thereof.
    "Vicarious Execution of Patch Processing" means vicarious execution service to create the Modified Source Code applying the Patch for Modification to the Source Code or the Binary Code thereof.

    The Source Code User and the System Developer shall be obligated to give a notice that the Source Code is used, in such a way as separately specified by T-Engine Forum, when they use the Source Code or the Binary Code, or make the Binary Code available for the End User on the Embedded Product.

Article 5. Distribution of Modified Source Code

    Any of A- members of T-Engine Forum may become the Distributor of Modification by obtaining the approval of T-Engine Forum through the registration procedure as prescribed by the Forum provided that only the department of the A- member which has taken the registration procedure may distribute the Modified Source Code in such a way as provided for in this Article as long as it holds the A- membership.
