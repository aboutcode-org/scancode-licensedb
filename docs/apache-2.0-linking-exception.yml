  EXCEPTION TO THE APACHE 2.0 LICENSE

  As a special exception to the Apache License 2.0 (and referring to the
  definitions in Section 1 of this license), you may link, statically or
  dynamically, the "Work" to other modules to produce an executable file
  containing portions of the "Work", and distribute that executable file
  in "Object" form under the terms of your choice, without any of the
  additional requirements listed in Section 4 of the Apache License 2.0.
  This exception applies only to redistributions in "Object" form (not
  "Source" form) and only if no modifications have been made to the "Work".
