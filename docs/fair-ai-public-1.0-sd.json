  "text": "# Fair AI Public License 1.0-SD\n\nPublished by the [Freedom of Development Project](https://freedevproject.org).\n\n*This \"SD variant\" license contains a [Prohibited Uses](#prohibited-uses)\nsection designed to be compatible with Stable Diffusion's license. Because of\nthat section, this is not a free software license. Unless you are releasing a\nderivative of a Stable Diffusion model, it is not recommended that you use this\nlicense.*\n\n*This license comes with special requirements if you intend to allow users\nto access this software over a network. See [Notices](#notices) for more\ninformation.*\n\n## Purpose\nThis license gives everyone as much permission to work with this software as \npossible, while protecting contributors from liability, protecting the \nfreedom of end users, and reducing harm.\n\n## Definitions\nIn this license, \"model\" refers to machine learning model weights, biases,\nparameters, optimizer states, and any byproducts of a training or pretraining\nprocess, whether in the form of checkpoints or any other form.\n\nThe term \"derived model\" refers to any model based on this model.\n\nThe term \"software\" also refers to any model along with documentation or\nother resources provided with the software.\n\nThe term \"source code\" refers to the preferred form of making modifications\nto software. It also includes any models, if applicable, but it does not\ninclude any datasets used to train a model.\n\nTo \"modify\" also means to perform any training on a model or to combine a\nmodel with another model.\n\n## Acceptance\nIn order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules. The rules of \nthis license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your \nlicense. You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that \nyou cannot or will not follow.

As a special case, if you are only allowing users to\ninteract with a derived model, then you may choose to provide a download link\nor written offer only for the derived model.\n\nThis software, all source code, and all modifications must be provided under\nthis license or another license that allows everything this license allows.\nNote that this does not give you permission to change the license for this\nsoftware.\n\n## Excuse\nIf anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with \n[Notices](#notices), you can keep your license by taking all practical steps\nto comply within 30 days after the notice. If you do not do so, your license\nends immediately.\n\n## Output\nThe output of this software is not covered by this license, and no contributor\nclaims any rights to it.\n\n## Patent\nEach contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would \notherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.\n\n## Reliability\nNo contributor can revoke this license.\n\n## Alternatives\nYou can also use any non-model parts of this software under the terms of the\nGNU AGPL 3.0, or any later version of that license. If you do,\n[No Harm](#no-harm) and [No Liability](#no-liability) still apply.\n\n## Revisions\nThe Freedom of Development Project may publish revised or new versions of the\nFair AI Public License. Those new versions will be similar in spirit to this\nlicense.\n\nUnless a contributor specifies otherwise, you have the option of following the\nterms of any later version of this license. Your choice to follow a later\nversion of the license will not impose additional obligations on any\ncontributor. Even if you do choose to follow a later version, the restrictions\nof [Prohibited Uses](#prohibited-uses) will still apply.\n\n## Survival\nThe provisions of [No Harm](#no-harm) and [No Liability](#no-liability) survive\nthe end of your license.\n\n## No Harm\nYou agree that no contributor's conduct in the creation of this software has \ncaused you any harm.
