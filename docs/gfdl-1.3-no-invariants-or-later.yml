  \ of the GNU Free Documentation\nLicense, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the\
  \ Free Software\nFoundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-\n\
  Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\nFree Documentation\
  \ License\".\n\n                GNU Free Documentation License\n                 Version 1.3,\
  \ 3 November 2008\n\n\n Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,\
  \ Inc.\n     <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
  \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose\
  \ of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document\
  \ \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and\
  \ redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\n\
  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for\
  \ their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\n\
  This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document\
  \ must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License,\
  \ which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License\
  \ in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation:\
  \ a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware\
  \ does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual\
  \ work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend\
  \ this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n1. APPLICABILITY\
  \ AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n\
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms\
  \ of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in\
  \ duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\n\
  refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed\
  \ as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way\
  \ requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means\
  \ any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\n\
  modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named\
  \ appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship\
  \ of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to\
  \ related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.\
  \  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not\
  \ explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection\
  \ with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical\
  \ or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary\
  \ Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\n\
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the\
  \ above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The\
  \ Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\n\
  Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that\
  \ are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe\
  \ Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and\
  \ a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means\
  \ a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\n\
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic\
  \ text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)\
  \ some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters\
  \ or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.\
  \  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup,\
  \ has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\n\
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that\
  \ is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent\
  \ copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\n\
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or\
  \ PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG,\
  \ XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\
  \ by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools\
  \ are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced\
  \ by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed\
  \ book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
  \ the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats\
  \ which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent\
  \ appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nThe\
  \ \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the\
  \ public.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle\
  \ either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ\
  \ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such\
  \ as \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve\
  \ the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection\
  \ \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers\
  \ next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\n\
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards\
  \ disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have\
  \ is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou\
  \ may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially,\
  \ provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License\
  \ applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\nother conditions\
  \ whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or\
  \ control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,\
  \ you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\n\
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies,\
  \ under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n3. COPYING\
  \ IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted\
  \ covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires\
  \ Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all\
  \ these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back\
  \ cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these\
  \ copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally\
  \ prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying\
  \ with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document\
  \ and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n\
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put\
  \ the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the\
  \ rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\
  \ numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along\
  \ with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location\
  \ from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard\
  \ network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\n\
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution\
  \ of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible\
  \ at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\n\
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\
  \nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before\
  \ redistributing any large number of copies, to\ngive them a chance to provide you with an\
  \ updated version of the\nDocument.\n\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a\
  \ Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided\
  \ that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n\
  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of\
  \ the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these\
  \ things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any)\
  \ a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n  \
  \ (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).\
  \  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that\
  \ version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or\
  \ entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version,\
  \ together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal\
  \ authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\n\
  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\
  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice\
  \ for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately\
  \ after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the\
  \ Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum\
  \ below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and\
  \ required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy\
  \ of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and\
  \ add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of\
  \ the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \"\
  History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher\
  \ of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n\
  \   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any,\
  \ given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n\
  \   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.\
  \  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for\
  \ a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the\
  \ original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section\
  \ Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section,\
  \ and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n\
  \   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n\
  \   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are\
  \ not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\"\
  .  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any\
  \ existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant\
  \ Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new\
  \ front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\n\
  copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections\
  \ as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified\
  \ Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\
  \nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements\
  \ of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or\
  \ that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\n\
  standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage\
  \ of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified\
  \ Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added\
  \ by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes\
  \ a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the\
  \ same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the\
  \ old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\n\
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to\
  \ use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\
  \n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under\
  \ this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided\
  \ that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original\
  \ documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in\
  \ its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined\
  \ work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections\
  \ may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the\
  \ same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding\
  \ at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that\
  \ section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles\
  \ in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the\
  \ combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original\
  \ documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\
  \ \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\n\
  Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting\
  \ of the Document and other\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual\n\
  copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\nthat is included in the\
  \ collection, provided that you follow the rules\nof this License for verbatim copying of\
  \ each of the documents in all\nother respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from\
  \ such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert\
  \ a\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\nLicense in all other\
  \ respects regarding verbatim copying of that\ndocument.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT\
  \ WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent\
  \ documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an\
  \ \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the\
  \ legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen\
  \ the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works\
  \ in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover\
  \ Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the\
  \ Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may\
  \ be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic\
  \ equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear\
  \ on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation\
  \ is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document\
  \ under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n\
  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all\
  \ Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You\
  \ may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument,\
  \ and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version\
  \ of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of\
  \ a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\n\
  or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled\
  \ \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\n\
  its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\
  \nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\nexcept as expressly provided\
  \ under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it\
  \ is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\nHowever, if\
  \ you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright\
  \ holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly\
  \ and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails\
  \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\
  \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if\
  \ the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the\
  \ first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n\
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\
  \nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties\
  \ who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been\
  \ terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same\
  \ material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.\n\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\
  \nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\nGNU Free Documentation\
  \ License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present\
  \ version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\
  \nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies\
  \ that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to\
  \ it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified\
  \ version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software\
  \ Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may\
  \ choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If\
  \ the Document\nspecifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\nLicense can\
  \ be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\nversion permanently authorizes\
  \ you to choose that version for the\nDocument.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\n\"Massive Multiauthor\
  \ Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\
  \ works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\npublic\
  \ wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\"\
  \ (or \"MMC\") contained in the site\nmeans any set of copyrightable works thus published\
  \ on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\
  \ \nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit \ncorporation with\
  \ a principal place of business in San Francisco, \nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft\
  \ versions of that license \npublished by that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means\
  \ to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in \npart, as part of another Document.\n\
  \nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this \nLicense, and if all\
  \ works that were first published under this License \nsomewhere other than this MMC, and\
  \ subsequently incorporated in whole or \nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or\
  \ invariant sections, and \n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator\
  \ of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site\
  \ at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\n\n\
  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document\
  \ you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright\
  \ and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n\
  \    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the\
  \ terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\n    or any later version published\
  \ by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts,\
  \ and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled\
  \ \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover\
  \ Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the\
  \ Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST,\
  \ and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover\
  \ Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\n\
  situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend\
  \ releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as\
  \ the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software."
