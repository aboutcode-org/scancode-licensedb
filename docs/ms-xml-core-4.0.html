b.	Sample Code. You may modify the portions of the SDK designated as &#34;Sample Code&#34; for the purpose of designing, developing and testing your Application.

(ii)	If you redistribute the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in conjunction with your Application, your Application must include a valid copyright notice in your own name, which notice shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft’s copyright in the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT;
(iii)	If you redistribute the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in conjunction with your Application, and if your Application does not display Microsoft’s end user license agreement to your end user, then your Application must be accompanied by license terms that are at least as restrictive as, and as protective of Microsoft as, those contained in this EULA.;
(iv)	You shall not use Microsoft’s name, logo or trademarks to market your Application;
(v)	You shall not modify or alter the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT in any way; provided that you may merge those files in the SOFTWARE and/or COMPONENT with &#34;msm&#34; extensions into the &#34;msm&#34; files of your Application;
(vi)	You shall not redistribute individual parts or files of the COMPONENT; you must redistribute the COMPONENT in its entirety;
(vii)	You shall not redistribute the SDK separately; the SDK may only be redistributed as part of the SOFTWARE in its entirety; and
