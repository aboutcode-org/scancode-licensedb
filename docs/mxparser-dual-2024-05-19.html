    The license is granted only to you, the person or entity that made the purchase, identified and confirmed by the data provided during the purchase.

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON WORKSTATION

A workstation is a device, a remote device, or a virtual device used by you, your employees, or other entities to whom you have commissioned tasks. For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number of software developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other professionals who use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of workstations is not the number of copies of your end-product that you distribute to your end-users.

By purchasing the COMMERCIAL LICENSE, you only pay for the number of workstations, while the number of copies/users of your final product (delivered to your end-users) is not limited.

Below are some examples to help you select the right license size:

Example 1: Single Workstation License

Only one developer works on the development of your application. You do not use separate environments for testing, meaning you design, create, test, and compile your final application on one environment. In this case, you need a license for a single workstation.

Example 2: Up to 5 Workstations License

Two developers are working on the development of your application. Additionally, one tester conducts tests in a separate environment. You use three workstations in total, so you need a license for up to five workstations.

Example 3: Up to 20 Workstations License

Ten developers are working on the development of your application. Additionally, five testers conduct tests in separate environments. You use fifteen workstations in total, so you need a license for up to twenty workstations.

Example 4: Site License

Several dozen developers and testers work on the development of your application using multiple environments. You have a large, multi-disciplinary team involved in creating your solution. As your team is growing and you want to avoid licensing limitations, the best choice would be a site license.

UPGRADE POLICY

The PRODUCT is versioned according to the following convention:

[MAJOR] . [MINOR] . [PATCH]

    COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders can install and use the updated version for bug fixes free of charge, i.e., if you have purchased a license for the [MAJOR] . [MINOR] version (e.g., 5.0), you can freely install all releases specified in the [PATCH] version (e.g., 5.0.2). The license terms remain unchanged after the update.
    COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders for the [MAJOR] . [MINOR] version (e.g., 5.0) can install and use the updated version [MAJOR] . [MINOR + 1] free of charge, i.e., plus one release in the [MINOR] range (e.g., 5.1). The license terms remain unchanged after the update.
    COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders who wish to upgrade their version but are not eligible for the free upgrade, can claim a discount when purchasing the upgrade. For this purpose, please contact us via email.
