It\napplies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by\nthe copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3\nalong with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC\nheader files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of\nthis Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary)\nprograms to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by\nthis Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for\nexecution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by\nthe Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU\nGeneral Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions\npublished by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the\nlicense of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target\nprocessor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an\nassembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target\nCode does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate\nrepresentation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-\nintermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual\nMachine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code\ngenerators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation\nProcess, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the\noutput of the generators or preprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other\nGPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC.\nFor example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate\nrepresentations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the\nRuntime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would\notherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was\ngenerated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a\ncombination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the\nIndependent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that\nthird-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license\nof GCC."
