BY INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU\nHAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL\nAGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT\nINSTALL OR USE SUCH SOFTWARE.  IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING SUCH SOFTWARE ON\nBEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY\nTO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TSL AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT\nLEGAL ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO BIND THAT LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS TSL AGREEMENT.\n\nThis TSL Agreement is entered into by and between Timescale, Inc. (\"Timescale\")\nand you or the legal entity on whose behalf you are accepting this TSL\nAgreement (\"You\").\n\n0. BACKGROUND\n\n   The Timescale time-series database software and related software is offered\n   as \"open code\" or \"source-available\" code.  This means that all source code\n   of the software is available for inspection and download at\n   https://github.com/timescale.  The Timescale software is composed of two\n   major pieces.\n\n   The first piece (referred to herein as the Timescale Open Source Software,\n   as defined below) is open source software that is licensed under the Apache\n   Version 2.0 license.\n\n   The second piece (referred to herein as the TSL Licensed Software, as\n   defined below) is all of the Timescale Software other than the Timescale\n   Open Source Software. The TSL Licensed Software may be used under this TSL\n   Agreement without charge.\n\n1. GOVERNING LICENSES\n\n   1.1 Source Code.  The source code for all Timescale Software is made\n   publicly available by Timescale at https://github.com/timescale.  However,\n   different license agreements govern the use of different parts of the\n   Timescale Software source code.  The use of Timescale Open Source Software,\n   in both source and executable forms, is governed by the terms of the Apache\n   License Version 2.0, a copy of which is available at\n   https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.  The use of all other Timescale\n   Software, in both source and executable forms, is governed by this TSL\n   Agreement.\n\n   1.2 License Rights to Your Customers.  As set forth in Section 2.1 below,\n   the use by Your customers of the Timescale Software as part of any Value\n   Added Products or Services that You distribute will be subject to the most\n   current version of this TSL Agreement.\n\n2. GRANT OF LICENSES\n\n   2.1 Grant.  Conditioned upon compliance with all of the terms and conditions\n   of this TSL Agreement, Timescale grants to You at no charge the following\n   limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid up, worldwide licenses,\n   without the right to grant or authorize sublicenses (except as set forth in\n   Section 2.3):\n\n      (a) Internal Use.  A license to copy, compile, install, and use the\n      Timescale Software and Derivative Works solely for Your own internal\n      business purposes in a manner that does not expose or give access to,\n      directly or indirectly (e.g., via a wrapper), the Timescale Data\n      Definition Interfaces or the Timescale Data Manipulation Interfaces to\n      any person or entity other than You or Your employees and Contractors\n      working on Your behalf.\n\n      (b) Value Added Products or Services.  A license (i) to copy, compile,\n      install, and use the Timescale Software, Derivative Works, or parts\n      thereof to develop and maintain Your Value Added Products or Services,\n      (ii) to utilize (in the case of services) copies of the Timescale\n      Software, Derivative Works, or parts thereof solely as incorporated\n      into or utilized with Your Value Added Products or Services, and\n      (iii) to distribute (in the case of products that are distributed to\n      Your customers) copies of the Timescale Software binaries or of\n      Derivative Works solely in binary form, and both solely as incorporated\n      into or utilized with Your Value Added Products or Services; provided\n      that (1) You notify Your customers that use of such Timescale Software\n      or Derivative Works is subject to this TSL Agreement and You provide to\n      each such customer a copy of the most current version of this TSL\n      Agreement or a URL from which the most current version of this TSL\n      Agreement may be obtained, and (2) the customer is prohibited, either\n      contractually or technically, from defining, redefining, or modifying\n      the database schema or other structural aspects of database objects,\n      such as through use of the Timescale Data Definition Interfaces, in a\n      Timescale Database utilized by such Value Added Products or Services.\n\n      (c) Distribution of Source Code or Binaries in Standalone Form.  Subject\n      to the prohibitions in Section 2.2 below, a license to copy and\n      distribute the Timescale Software source code and binaries solely in\n      unmodified standalone form and subject to the terms and conditions of\n      the most current version of this TSL Agreement.\n\n      (d) Derivative Works.  A license (i) to prepare, compile, and test\n      Derivative Works of the TSL Licensed Software; (ii) to use Derivative\n      Works for Internal Use solely as expressly permitted in Section 2.1(a);\n      (iii) to utilize Derivative Works with Your Value Added Products or\n      Services solely as expressly permitted in Section 2.1(b); (iv) to\n      distribute Derivative Works in binary form with Your Value Added\n      Products or Services solely as expressly permitted in Section 2.1(b);\n      and (v) to distribute Derivative Works back to Timescale under\n      Timescale's Contributor Agreement for potential incorporation into\n      Timescale's maintained code base at its sole discretion.\n\n   2.2 Prohibitions.

In addition,\n   You agree not to, except as expressly permitted in Section 2.1(d), prepare\n   Derivative Works of any TSL Licensed Software or, except as expressly\n   permitted herein, transfer, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, loan, or\n   otherwise transfer or make available any TSL Licensed Software, whether in\n   source code or binary executable form.\n\n   2.3 Affiliates and Contractors.  You may permit Your Contractors and\n   Affiliates to exercise the licenses set forth in Section 2.1, provided that\n   such exercise by Contractors must be solely for your benefit and/or the\n   benefit of Your Affiliates, and You shall be responsible for all acts and\n   omissions of such Contractors and Affiliates in connection with such\n   exercise of the licenses, including but not limited to breach of any terms\n   of this TSL Agreement.\n\n   2.4 Reservation of Rights.  Except as expressly set forth in Section 2.1, no\n   other license or rights to the Timescale Software are granted to You under\n   this TSL Agreement, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.\n\n3.

GENERAL\n\n   7.1 Complete Agreement.  This TSL Agreement completely and exclusively\n   states the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter\n   hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, or other\n   communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject\n   matter.\n\n   7.2 Modification.  This TSL Agreement may be modified by Timescale from time\n   to time, and any such modifications will be effective upon the \"Posted Date\"\n   set forth at the top of the modified agreement. The modified agreement shall\n   govern any new version of the TSL Licensed Software (and all its constituent\n   source code and binaries) that is officially released as a complete version\n   release by Timescale on or after such Posted Date. Except as set forth in\n   this Section 7.2, this TSL Agreement may not be amended except by a writing\n   executed by both parties.\n\n   7.3 Governing Law.  This TSL Agreement shall be governed by and construed\n   solely under the laws of the State of New York, without application of any\n   choice of law rules or principles that would lead to the applicability of\n   the law of any other jurisdiction.  None of the provisions of either the\n   United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods\n   or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall apply.\n\n   7.4 Unenforceability.  If any provision of this TSL Agreement is held\n   unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this TSL Agreement shall remain\n   in effect and the unenforceable provision shall be replaced by an\n   enforceable provision that best reflects the original intent of the parties.\n\n   7.5 Injunctive Relief.  You acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach\n   of any provision of this TSL Agreement will cause irreparable harm to\n   Timescale for which damages at law will not provide adequate relief, and\n   Timescale shall therefore be entitled to injunctive relief against such\n   breach or threatened breach without being required to post a bond.\n\n   7.6 Assignment.  You may not assign this TSL Agreement, including by\n   operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition or otherwise,\n   in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Timescale, which\n   Timescale may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.  Any\n   assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void.\n\n   7.7 Independent Contractors.  The parties to this TSL Agreement are\n   independent contractors and this TSL Agreement does not establish any\n   relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency\n   between the parties.\n\n   7.8 U.S. Government Rights.  The Timescale Software and related\n   documentation are \"Commercial Items\", as that term is defined at 48\n   C.F.R. \u00a72.101, consisting of \"Commercial Computer Software\" and \"Commercial\n   Computer Software Documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48\n   C.F.R. \u00a712.212 or 48 C.F.R. \u00a7227.7202, as applicable, and\n   are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as\n   Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other\n   end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this TSL Agreement."
