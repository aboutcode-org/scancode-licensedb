5. NO WARRANTIES

The Software is provided “AS IS” and Licensor makes no warranty as to its use, performance, or otherwise.

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

This limitation of liability is to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. In no event shall Licensor be liable for any costs of substitute products or services, or for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, or loss of business information) arising out of the use or inability to use the Software, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In any case, Licensor&#39;s entire liability arising out of this Agreement shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid for the Software; provided, however, that if you have entered into a Technical Services Support Agreement, Licensor&#39;s entire liability regarding support services shall be governed by the terms of that agreement.</code></pre>
