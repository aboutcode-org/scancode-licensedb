SECTION 22 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT LIMITS YOUR ABILITY TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, AND WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS FOR CERTAIN DISPUTES. AN \u201cOPT-OUT\u201d IS AVAILABLE UNDER SECTION 22.7 FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER.\n\nIF YOU ACQUIRE THIS PRODUCT IN AUSTRALIA, SECTIONS 24-36 OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY APPLY TO YOU.

Other Rights and Limitations.\n\nYou agree not to modify, adapt or translate the Software and further agree not to attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software.

The Software is licensed as a single unit, and its component programs may not be separated for some other use. Further, you agree not to place the Software onto or into a shared environment accessible via a public network such as the Internet or otherwise accessible by others outside the single location referred to in Section 1 above.\n\n4.

The Software is protected by United States Copyright Law, copyright laws of Japan and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. There is no transfer to you of any title to or ownership of the Software and this License shall not be construed as a sale of any rights in the Software.

Open Source and Other Third-Party Components.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing license grant, you acknowledge that certain components of the Software may be covered by third-party licenses, including so-called \u201copen source\u201d software licenses, which means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format (such third-party components, \u201cThird-Party Components\u201d). A list of Third-Party Components, and associated license terms (as required), for particular versions of the Software is indicated at https://support.epson.net/terms/, the end of this Agreement, relevant user manual/CD, or the license information displayed on your Device/in Software. To the extent required by the licenses covering Third-Party Components, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement.

Multiple Versions of Software.\n\nYou may receive or obtain the Software in more than one version (e.g. for different operating environments; two or more language translation versions; downloaded from an Epson server or on a CD-ROM), however, regardless of the type or number of copies you receive, you still may use only the media or version appropriate for the license granted in Section 1 above.\n\n7.    Disclaimer of Warranty and Remedy. \n\nSubject to Section 25 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), if you obtained the Software by media from Epson or a dealer, Epson warrants that the media on which the Software is recorded will be free from defects in workmanship and materials under normal use for a period of 90 days from the date of delivery to you. If the media is returned to Epson or the dealer from which the media was obtained within 90 days of the date of delivery to you, and if Epson determines the media to be defective and provided the media was not subject to misuse, abuse, misapplication or use in defective equipment, Epson will replace the media, upon your return to Epson of the Software, including all copies of any portions thereof. You acknowledge and agree that the use of the Software is at your sole risk. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EPSON AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SOFTWARE. Epson does not warrant that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted, error free, free from viruses or other harmful components or vulnerabilities, or that the functions of the Software will meet your needs or requirements. Epson\u2019s sole and exclusive liability and your exclusive remedy for breach of warranty shall be limited to either, at Epson\u2019s option, the replacement of the media for the Software or to refund your money upon returning the Software and Epson Hardware. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. If the above remedy fails for any reason, Epson\u2019s entire liability for a breach of warranty shall be limited to a refund of the price paid for the Epson Hardware. Epson is not liable for performance delays or for nonperformance due to causes beyond its reasonable control. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. THE STATED LIMITED WARRANTIES AND REMEDY ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHERS. EPSON DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, HOWEVER, DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND IN SUCH STATES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8.    Limitation of Liability.\n\nSubject to Sections 25 and/or 28 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EPSON OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING UNDER CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, MISREPRESENTATION, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF EPSON OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, AND IN SUCH STATES, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY.\n\n9.    U.S. Government Acquisition of the Software.\n\nThis Section applies to all acquisitions of the Software by or for the U.S. Government (\u201cGovernment\u201d), or by any prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) under any contract, grant, cooperative agreement, \u201cother transaction\u201d (\u201cOT\u201d), or other activity with the Government. By accepting delivery of the Software, the Government, any prime contractor, and any subcontractor agree that the Software qualifies as \u201ccommercial\u201d computer software within the meaning of FAR Part 12, paragraph (b) of FAR Subpart 27.405, or DFARS Subpart 227.7202, as applicable, and that no other regulation, or FAR or DFARS data rights clause, applies to the delivery of this Software to the Government. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement govern the Government\u2019s (and the prime contractor and subcontractor\u2019s) use and disclosure of the Software, and supersede any conflicting terms and conditions of the contract, grant, cooperative agreement, OT, or other activity pursuant to which the Software is delivered to the Government. If this Software fails to meet the Government\u2019s needs, if this Agreement is inconsistent in any respect with Federal law, or if the above cited FAR and DFARS provisions do not govern, the Government agrees to return the Software, unused, to Epson.\n\n10.    Export Restriction.\n\nYou agree that the Software will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions or regulations.\n\n11.    Entire Agreement.\n\nSubject to Section 28 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), this Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties related to the Software and supersedes any purchase order, communication, advertisement, or representation concerning the Software.\n\n12.    Binding Agreement; Assignees.\n\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns and legal representatives.\n\n13.    Severability; Modifications.\n\nIf any provision herein is found void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction (subject to Section 22.8 and 22.9 if you are a located in the U.S.), it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. Subject to Section 28 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), his Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by an authorized representative of Epson.\n\n14.    Indemnification.\n\nSubject to Section 28 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), you agree that you will indemnify and hold harmless, and upon Epson\u2019s request, defend Epson and its directors, officers, shareholders, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), actions, suits, and claims arising from (i) any breach of any of your obligations in this Agreement or (ii) any use of the Software or the Epson Hardware. If Epson asks you to defend any such action, suit or claim, Epson will have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense thereof with counsel of its choice. You will not settle any third-party claims for which Epson is entitled to indemnification without the prior written approval of Epson.\n\n15.    Termination.\n\nSubject to Section 28 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), without prejudice to any other rights Epson has, your license rights under Section 1 above and your warranty rights under Section 7 above, shall automatically terminate upon failure by you to comply with this Agreement. Upon termination of such rights, you agree that the Software, and all copies thereof, will be immediately destroyed.\n\n16.    Capacity and Authority to Contract.\n\nSubject to Section 28 (which may apply to you if you acquire goods and services from Epson in Australia), you represent that you are of the legal age of majority in your state or jurisdiction of residence and have all necessary authority to enter into this Agreement, including, if applicable, due authorization by your employer to enter into this Agreement.\n\n17.    Privacy, Information Processing.\n\nThe Software may have the ability to connect over the Internet to transmit data to and from your Device. For example, if you install the Software, the Software may cause your Device to send information about your Epson Hardware such as model and serial number, country identifier, language code, operating system information, and Epson Hardware usage information to an Epson Internet site which may return promotional or service information to your Device for display. Any processing of information provided through the Software, shall be according to applicable data protection laws and the Epson Privacy Policy located at https://global.epson.com/privacy/area_select_confirm_eula.html. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, by agreeing to the terms of this Agreement and by installing the Software, you consent to the processing and storage of your information in and/or outside your country of residence. If there is a specific privacy policy incorporated into the Software and/or displayed when you use the Software (for example, in the case of certain software application software), such specific privacy policy shall prevail over the Epson Privacy Policy stated above.

Ink Purchases.\n\nFor certain Epson printer products sold in North America, the Software may also display an option to buy ink from Epson.

Epson Accounts and Promotional Messages.\n\nIn addition, if you install the Software and register your Epson Hardware with Epson, and/or you create an account at the Epson Store, and provided your consent to such use, you agree that Epson may merge the data collected in connection with installation of the Software, registration of your Epson Hardware and/or creation of your Epson Store account, consisting of personal information and non-personally identifiable information, and use such merged data to send you Epson promotional or service information.

On a Mac operating system, you can disable these features by uninstalling the Epson Customer Research Participation and Low Ink Reminder software.\n\n22.    DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS\n\n22.1    Disputes.\n\nThe terms of this Section 22 shall apply to all Disputes between you and Epson. The term \u201cDispute\u201d is meant to have the broadest meaning permissible under law or in equity and includes any past, present, or future dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and Epson including those that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its formation, performance, or breach), the Software, Epson Hardware, the parties\u2019 relationship with each other and/or any other transaction involving you and Epson, whether in contract, or with respect to warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. However, a \u201cDispute\u201d does not include a claim or cause of action for (a) trademark infringement or dilution, (b) patent infringement, (c) copyright infringement or misuse, or (d) trade secret misappropriation (an \u201cIP Claim\u201d). A \u201cDispute\u201d also does not include a request for public injunctive relief. You and Epson agree, consistent with Section 22.6(a), that a court, not an arbitrator, may decide if a claim or cause of action is for an IP Claim, as well as whether a claim seeks public injunctive relief.\n\n22.2    Initial Dispute Resolution.\n\nBefore submitting a claim for arbitration in accordance with this Section 22, you and Epson agree to try, for sixty (60) days, to resolve any Dispute informally. If Epson and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within the sixty (60) days, you or Epson may commence an arbitration in accordance with Section 22.6. Notice to Epson must be addressed to: Epson America, Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 3131 Katella Avenue, Los Alamitos, CA 90720-2335. Any notice of the Dispute shall include the sender\u2019s name, address and contact information, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested. Any notice sent to you will be sent to the most recent address Epson has in its records for you. For this reason, it is important to notify us if your address changes by emailing us at EAILegal@ea.epson.com or writing us at the address above. You and Epson agree to act in good faith to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration in accordance with this Section 22. To minimize the cost and inconvenience to all parties, and to promote prompt resolution of Disputes, you and we agree that engaging in this initial dispute resolution process is a material term of this Agreement and a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing any arbitration.\n\nConsistent with Section 22.6(a), you and Epson agree that any disagreements regarding compliance with this Section 22.2 shall be decided by a court, not an arbitrator; pending resolution of any such disagreements by a court, which may include requests to compel compliance with this Section 22.2, you and we agree that arbitration (as well as any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed until the initial dispute resolution process in Section 22.2 is complete. You and Epson acknowledge that either party\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 22.2 would irreparably harm the other, and you and Epson agree that a court may issue an order staying arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) until the initial dispute resolution process in this Section 22.2 is complete.\n\n22.3    Binding Arbitration.\n\nIf we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to Section 22.2 above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. Except as stated below in Section 22.4, you and Epson agree that all Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration according to this Agreement. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING, AND YOUR RIGHT TO DISCOVERY AND GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT. Pursuant to this Agreement, and except as stated below in Section 22.6(h), binding arbitration shall be administered by JAMS, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or its applicable code of procedures then in effect for consumer related disputes, but excluding any rules that permit class arbitration. For more detail on the procedure to initiate arbitration and what your demand for arbitration should include, see Sections 22.6(g) and 22.6(h) below. You and Epson understand and agree that (a) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 22, (b) this Agreement memorializes a transaction in interstate commerce, and (c) this Section 22 shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n\n22.4    Exception - Small Claims Court.\n\nNotwithstanding the parties\u2019 agreement to resolve Disputes through arbitration, either party can elect to have an individual claim resolved in small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction, even if the claim was initiated by another party in a different forum.\n\n22.5    WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION AND CLASS ARBITRATION.\n\nYOU AND EPSON AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS action or class arbitration. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 22.3 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n\n22.6    Arbitration Procedure.\n\n(a)     \n\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, except for requests for public injunctive relief, if any, which shall be decided by a court, not an arbitrator. If either party seeks public injunctive relief, that request for relief shall be severed from any arbitration proceeding and stayed pending a final determination of the arbitration. Nothing in Section 22 of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of either party\u2019s right to seek public injunctive relief, and you and we agree to cooperate to effect the stay of any requests for public injunctive relief.\n\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, and consistent with Sections 22.1, 22.2, 22.6(a) and 22.6(h) of this Agreement, a court may determine: (i) the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for an IP Claim, which is excluded from the definition of \u201cDisputes\u201d in Section 22.1 above; (ii) disagreements regarding compliance with the initial dispute resolution provisions in Section 22.2 above; (iii) disagreements regarding claims for public injunctive relief as set forth in this Section 22.6(a); and/or (iv) disagreements regarding the provisions for \u201cMass Arbitration\u201d in Section 22.6(h) below.\n\n(b) Costs of Arbitration and Legal Fees.\n\nIn some instances, the costs of arbitration can exceed the costs of litigation. Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. If, however, the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense asserted by you or Epson is patently frivolous or in bad faith, the arbitrator may award the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the other party defending against the claim or defense. By way of illustration only, and without limitation, a patently frivolous claim may be found where it is based on a product never purchased by a claimant.\n\n(c) Discovery.\n\nThe discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration. The right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n\n(d) Awards.\n\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(e) Hearing Format and Location.\n\nYou may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone or, if you and we both agree, to conduct it online, in lieu of appearing live. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone or online shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Orange County, California, at your option.\n\n(f) Settlement Offers.\n\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Epson is entitled.\n\n(g) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding Before JAMS.\n\nExcept as stated in Section 22.6(h) below, if you or Epson commences arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or the applicable rules of JAMS that are in effect when the arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, which shall be selected in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. If either you or Epson decides to arbitrate a Dispute before JAMS, both parties agree to the following procedure:\n\n(i) Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. The demand also must identify the product purchased, identify the date and place of purchase and, if possible, provide the serial number and proof of purchase. You can find a copy of a demand for arbitration at http://www.jamsadr.com.\n\n(ii) Send three copies of the demand for arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to: JAMS, 500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600 Orange, CA 92868, U.S.A.\n\n(iii) Send one copy of the demand for arbitration to the other party (at the same address as the notice of a dispute, above in section 22.2), or as otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\n(h) Initiation of Mass Arbitration Before FedArb.\n\nNotwithstanding Sections 22.3 and 22.6(g), if 20 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a \u201cMass Arbitration\u201d.\n\nIf a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by FedArb, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the FedArb Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the \u201cFedArb Rules\u201d), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The FedArb Rules are available at https://www.fedarb.com/ or by calling 1-650-328-9500. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using FedArb\u2019s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL, available at https://www.fedarb.com/.\n\nBefore any Mass Arbitration is filed with FedArb, you and we agree to contact FedArb jointly to advise that the parties intend to use FedArb\u2019s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on FedArb\u2019s claim form(s) and as directed by FedArb.\n\nConsistent with Section 22.6(a) above, you and Epson agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before FedArb, you or Epson may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction compelling compliance with this Section 22.6(h) and compelling administration of the Mass Arbitration before FedArb. Pending resolution of any such requests to a court, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. You and Epson acknowledge that either party\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 22.6(h) would irreparably harm the other, and you and Epson agree that a court may issue an order staying the arbitrations (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) until any disagreements over the provisions of this Section 22.6(h) are resolved by the court.\n\n22.7    30 Day Opt-out Right.\n\nYou may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class proceedings set forth in Sections 22.3 to 22.6 of this Agreement by sending a written letter to the Epson address listed above in Section 22.2 within thirty (30) days of your assent to this Agreement that specifies (i) your name, (ii) your mailing address, and (iii) your request to be excluded from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class proceedings specified in this Section 22. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms set forth in the Agreement, including this Section 22, shall continue to apply, including the requirement to provide notice prior to litigation. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Epson will also not be bound by them.\n\n22.8    Amendments to Section 22.\n\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Epson agree that if Epson makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to Epson\u2019s address) in this Agreement, Epson will obtain your affirmative assent to the applicable amendment. If you do not affirmatively assent to the applicable amendment, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between the parties in accordance with the language of this Section 22 (or resolve disputes as provided for in Section 22, if you timely elected to opt-out) when you first assented to this Agreement.\n\n22.9    Severability.\n\nIf any provision in this Section 22 is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class actions as provided in Section 22.5. This means that if Section 22.5 is found to be unenforceable, the entire Section 22 (but only Section 22) shall be null and void.\n\n23.    For New Jersey Residents.\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 7 OR 8 ARE HELD UNENFORCEABLE, VOID OR INAPPLICABLE UNDER NEW JERSEY LAW, THEN ANY SUCH PROVISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE REST OF THE AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN BINDING ON YOU AND EPSON. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO, NOR SHALL IT BE DEEMED OR CONSTRUED TO, LIMIT ANY RIGHTS AVAILABLE TO YOU UNDER THE TRUTH-IN-CONSUMER CONTRACT, WARRANTY AND NOTICE ACT.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING SECTIONS 24-36 OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ACQUIRE GOODS OR SERVICES IN AUSTRALIA (SEE SECTIONS 25 AND 28 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO WHEN THESE SECTIONS APPLY)\n\n24.
