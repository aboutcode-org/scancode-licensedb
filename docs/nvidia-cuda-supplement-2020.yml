  \ The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the \"doc\" \ndirectory, is distributed under the\
  \ same terms as the software itself. The\nbasic library functions are written in C and are\
  \ freestanding. Also \nincluded in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and\
  \ a just-\nin-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are \nboth\
  \ optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.\n\nTHE BASIC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS\n\
