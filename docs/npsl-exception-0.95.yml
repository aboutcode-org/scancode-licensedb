text: "Nmap Public Source License Version 0.95\nFor more information on this license, see https://nmap.org/npsl/\n\
  \n0. Preamble\n\nThe intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change\n\
  the software regulated by this license under the open source model. It\nalso includes a Contributor\
  \ Agreement and disclaims any warranty on\nCovered Software. Companies wishing to use or incorporate\
  \ Covered\nSoftware within their own products may find that our Nmap OEM product\n(https://nmap.org/oem/)\
  \ better suits their needs. Open source\ndevelopers who wish to incorporate parts of Covered\
  \ Software into free\nsoftware with conflicting licenses may write Licensor to request a\n\
  waiver of terms.\n\nIf the Nmap Project (directly or through one of its commercial\nlicensing\
  \ customers) has granted you additional rights to Nmap or Nmap\nOEM, those additional rights\
  \ take precedence where they conflict with\nthe terms of this license agreement.\n\nThis License\
  \ represents the complete agreement concerning subject\nmatter hereof. It contains the license\
  \ terms themselves, but not the\nreasoning behind them or detailed explanations. For further\n\
  information about this License, see https://nmap.org/npsl/ . That page\nmakes a good faith\
  \ attempt to explain this License, but it does not\nand can not modify its governing terms\
  \ in any way.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n* \"Contribution\" means any work of authorship, including\
  \ the original\n  version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work\n  or\
  \ Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to\n  Licensor by the copyright\
  \ owner or by an individual or Legal Entity\n  authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright\
  \ owner. For the\n  purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of\n  electronic,\
  \ verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or\n  its representatives, including\
  \ but not limited to communication on\n  electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
  \ web sites,\n  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n  Licensor\
  \ for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n  excluding communication that\
  \ is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n  designated in writing by the copyright owner as\
  \ \"Not a\n  Contribution.\"\n\n* \"Contributor\" means Licensor and any individual or Legal\
  \ Entity on\n  behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n  subsequently\
  \ incorporated within the Work.\n\n* \"Covered Software\" means the work of authorship, whether\
  \ in Source\n  or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n  copyright\
  \ notice that is included in or attached to the work\n\n* \"Derivative Work\" or \"Collective\
  \ Work\" means any work, whether in\n  Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived\
  \ from) the Work\n  and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or\n\
  \  other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of\n  authorship. It includes\
  \ software as described in Section 3 of this\n  License.\n\n* \"Executable\" means Covered\
  \ Software in any form other than Source Code.\n\n* \"Externally Deploy\" means to Deploy\
  \ the Covered Software in any way\n  that may be accessed or used by anyone other than You,\
  \ used to\n  provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way to\n  deliver\
  \ any content to anyone other than You, whether the Covered\n  Software is distributed to\
  \ those parties, made available as an\n  application intended for use over a computer network,\
  \ or used to\n  provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than\n  You.\n\
  \n* \"GPL\" means the GNU General Public License Version 2, as published\n  by the Free Software\
  \ Foundation and provided in Exhibit A.\n\n* \"Legal Entity\" means the union of the acting\
  \ entity and all other\n  entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n\
  \  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n  \"control\" means (i)\
  \ the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n  direction or management of such entity, whether\
  \ by contract or\n  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n \
  \ outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n* \"License\" means\
  \ this document, including Exhibits.\n\n* \"Licensor\" means Nmap Software LLC and its successors\
  \ and assigns.\n\n* \"Main License Body\" means all of the terms of this document,\n  excluding\
  \ Exhibits.\n\n* \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising\n  permissions\
  \ granted by this License.\n\n2. General Terms\n\nCovered Software is licensed to you under\
  \ the terms of the GPL\n(Exhibit A), with all the exceptions, clarifications, and additions\n\
  noted in this Main License Body. Where the terms in this Main License\nBody conflict in any\
  \ way with the GPL, the Main License Body terms\nshall take precedence. These additional terms\
  \ mean that You may not\ndistribute Covered Software or Derivative Works under plain GPL terms\n\
  without special permission from Licensor.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License.\
  \ However, nothing else\ngrants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software\n\
  or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do\nnot accept this License.\
  \ Therefore, by modifying, copying or\ndistributing the software (or any work based on the\
  \ software), You\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\nand\
  \ conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by\nclicking the Accept\
  \ button or downloading the software.\n\n3. Derivative Works\n\nThis License (including the\
  \ GPL portion) places important restrictions\non derived works. Licensor interprets that term\
  \ quite broadly. To\navoid any misunderstandings, we consider software to constitute a\n\"\
  derivative work\" of Covered Software for the purposes of this license\nif it does any of\
  \ the following:\n\n* Integrates source code from Covered Software\n\n* Reads or includes\
  \ Covered Software data files, such as nmap-os-db or\n  nmap-service-probes.\n\n* Is designed\
  \ specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the\n  results (as opposed to typical\
  \ shell or execution-menu apps, which\n  will execute anything you tell them to).\n\n* Includes\
  \ Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer. The\n  installers produced by InstallShield\
  \ are an example of\n  this. Including Nmap with other software in compressed or archival\n\
  \  form does not trigger this provision, provided appropriate open\n  source decompression\
  \ or de-archiving software is widely available\n  for no charge. For the purposes of this\
  \ license, an installer is\n  considered to include Covered Software even if it actually retrieves\n\
  \  a copy of Covered Software from another source during runtime (such\n  as by downloading\
  \ it from the Internet).\n\n* Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any\
  \ of the\n  above\n\n* Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.\n\
  \n\nThis list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify Licensor's\nintentions with some common\
  \ examples. Distribution of any works which\nmeet these criteria (and that also choose to\
  \ accept this license to\nbenefit from the rights granted herein) must be under the terms\
  \ of\nthis license (including this Main License Body and GPL), with no\nadditional conditions\
  \ or restrictions. They must abide by all\nrestrictions that the GPL places on derivative\
  \ or collective works,\nincluding the requirements for distributing their source code and\n\
  allowing royalty-free redistribution.\n\nLicensor does not purport to control through this\
  \ license any software\nwhich does not require the rights granted herein (such as rights to\n\
  redistribute and/or incorporate Covered Software executables and\nsource code). In particular,\
  \ many software packages include the\nability to parse Covered Software results provided by\
  \ an end user or\nto execute Covered Software that end user may have already installed\non\
  \ their system. To the extent that copyright doctrines such as fair\nuse allow their practices\
  \ without the need to exercise any rights\ngranted by this license, vendors and distributors\
  \ of such software are\nnot bound by our definition of derivative works or any other clauses\n\
  in this license.\n\n4. Contributor Agreement (Grant of Copyright and Patent Licenses)\n\n\
  Each Contributor hereby grants to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge,\
  \ royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\nto reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
  \ publicly display, publicly\nperform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and such\n\
  Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to You and Licensor\
  \ a perpetual,\nworldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except\nas\
  \ stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,\noffer to sell, sell, import,\
  \ and otherwise transfer the Work, where\nsuch license applies only to those patent claims\
  \ licensable by such\nContributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\n\
  alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to\nwhich such Contribution(s)\
  \ was submitted. If You institute patent\nlitigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\
  \ or counterclaim\nin a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated\nwithin\
  \ the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then any patent licenses\
  \ granted to You under this\nLicense for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation\n\
  is filed.\n\nContributors may impose different terms on their Contributions by\nstating those\
  \ terms in writing at the time the Contribution is\nmade. Contributors may withhold all authority\
  \ from Licensor to\nincorporate submissions by conspicuously marking or otherwise\ndesignating\
  \ them in writing as \"Not a Contribution\" at the time they\nmake the work available.\n\n\
  5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability\n\nUnless required by applicable law\
  \ or agreed to in writing, Licensor\nprovides the Covered Software (and each Contributor provides\
  \ its\nContributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\nOF ANY KIND,\
  \ either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nany warranties or conditions\
  \ of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are\
  \ solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using or\nredistributing the\
  \ Covered Software and assume any risks associated\nwith Your exercise of permissions under\
  \ this License.\n\nIn no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\nnegligence),\
  \ contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n(such as deliberate and grossly\
  \ negligent acts) or agreed to in\nwriting, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,\
  \ including\nany direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of\nany character\
  \ arising as a result of this License or out of the use or\ninability to use the Covered Software\
  \ (including but not limited to\ndamages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure\
  \ or\nmalfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even\nif such Contributor\
  \ has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n6. External Deployment\n\nIf You\
  \ Externally Deploy Covered Software, such as hosting a website\ndesigned to execute Nmap\
  \ scans for users, the system and its\ndocumentation must, if technically feasible, prominently\
  \ display a\nnotice stating that the system uses the Nmap Security Scanner to\nperform its\
  \ tasks. If technically feasible, the notice must contain a\nhyperlink to https://nmap.org/\
  \ or provide that URL in the text.\n\n7. Trademarks\n\nThis License does not grant permission\
  \ to use the trade names,\ntrademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except\
  \ as\nrequired for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of\nthe Covered Software.\n\
  \n8. Termination for Patent Action\n\nThis License shall terminate automatically and You may\
  \ no longer\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the\ndate You\
  \ commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor or any licensee\
  \ alleging that the Covered Software\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall\
  \ not apply for an\naction alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Covered\nSoftware\
  \ with other software or hardware.\n\n9. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law\n\nThis License\
  \ is governed by the laws of the State of Washington and\nthe intellectual property laws of\
  \ the United States of America,\nexcluding the jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions.\
  \ Any\nlitigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor\nrelating to this License\
  \ shall take place in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, and You and Licensor hereby consent\
  \ to the personal\njurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within\nthat\
  \ District with respect to this License. The application of the\nUnited Nations Convention\
  \ on Contracts for the International Sale of\nGoods is expressly excluded.\n\n10. Npcap and\
  \ the Official Nmap Windows Builds\n\nThe official Windows Nmap builds includes the Npcap\
  \ driver and library\n(https://npcap.com) for packet capture and transmission on\nWindows.\
  \ That software is under its own separate license terms rather\nthan this license. Therefore\
  \ anyone wishing to use or redistribute\nboth pieces of software must comply with both licenses.\
  \ Since Npcap\ndoes not allow for redistribution without special permission, the\nofficial\
  \ Nmap Windows builds which include Npcap may not be\nredistributed without special permission.\
  \ Such permission can be\nrequested by email to sales@nmap.com.\n\n11. Permission to link\
  \ with OpenSSL\n\nLicensor grants permission to link Covered Software with any version\nof\
  \ the OpenSSL library from OpenSSL.Org, and distribute linked\ncombinations including the\
  \ two (assuming such distribution is\notherwise allowed by this agreement). You must obey\
  \ this License in\nall respects for all code used other than OpenSSL.\n\n12. Waiver; Construction\n\
  \nFailure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of\nthis License will not\
  \ be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that\nor any other provision. Any law or regulation\
  \ which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will\
  \ not\napply to this License.\n\n13. Enforceability\n\nIf any provision of this License is\
  \ invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\
  \ of\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties\
  \ hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision\
  \ valid and enforceable.\n\nExhibit A. The GNU General Public License Version 2\nGNU GENERAL\
  \ PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation,\
  \ Inc.  \n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted\
  \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not\
  \ allowed.\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\n\
  to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee\
  \ your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all\
  \ its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's\
  \ software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software\
  \ Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can\
  \ apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to\
  \ freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave\
  \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish),\
  \ that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software\
  \ or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n\
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these\
  \ rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
  \ for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
  \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give\
  \ the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive\
  \ or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\
  \nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this\
  \ license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\
  \nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands\
  \ that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone\
  \ else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal,\
  \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\
  \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid\
  \ the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses,\
  \ in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n\
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms\
  \ and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\
  \ FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or\
  \ other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n\
  under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such\
  \ program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative\
  \ work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of\
  \ it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter,\
  \ translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee\
  \ is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification\
  \ are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program\
  \ is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute\
  \ a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether\
  \ that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim\
  \ copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
  \ conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n\
  and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to\
  \ the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this\
  \ License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
  \ a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n\
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a\
  \ work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the\
  \ terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You\
  \ must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files\
  \ and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
  \ that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\nthereof,\
  \ to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\nunder the terms of this License.\n\
  \nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\nrun, you must cause\
  \ it, when started running for such interactive use\nin the most ordinary way, to print or\
  \ display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there\
  \ is\nno warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute\
  \ the program under these conditions, and telling\nthe user how to view a copy of this License.\
  \ (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\n\
  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\nan announcement.)\n\
  \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that\
  \ work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and\
  \ separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n\
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections\
  \ as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole\
  \ must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is\
  \ not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely\
  \ by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative\
  \ or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work\
  \ not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
  \ of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this\
  \ License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section\
  \ 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided\
  \ that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding\
  \ machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n\
  and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it\
  \ with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\nto give any third party, for a charge\
  \ no more than your cost of\nphysically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\n\
  copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\nterms of Sections 1 and\
  \ 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with\
  \ the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This\
  \ alternative is allowed\nonly for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n\
  program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\naccord with Subsection b\
  \ above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications\
  \ to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules\
  \ it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n\
  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception,\
  \ the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in\
  \ either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of\
  \ the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies\
  \ the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess\
  \ to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code\
  \ from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties\
  \ are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy,\
  \ modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.\
  \ Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\n\
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received\
  \ copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated\
  \ so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept\
  \ this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission\
  \ to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited\
  \ by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program\
  \ (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\
  \ so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program\
  \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on\
  \ the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor\
  \ to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may\
  \ not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\n\
  herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\
  \n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for\
  \ any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether\
  \ by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
  \ they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so\
  \ as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent\
  \ obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example,\
  \ if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall\
  \ those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could\
  \ satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the\
  \ Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular\
  \ circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole\
  \ is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to\
  \ induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
  \ of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the\
  \ free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many\
  \ people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough\
  \ that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor\
  \ to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a\
  \ licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
  \ what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution\
  \ and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\
  \ interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay\
  \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that\
  \ distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this\
  \ License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The\
  \ Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public\
  \ License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
  \ but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given\
  \ a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License\
  \ which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms\
  \ and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software\
  \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of this License, you may choose\
  \ any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
  \ parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different,\
  \ write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree\
  \ Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions\
