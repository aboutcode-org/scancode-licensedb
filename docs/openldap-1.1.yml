  \ Foundation. \nAll Rights Reserved. \n\nNote: \nThis license is derived from the \"Artistic\
  \ License\" as distributed \nwith the Perl Programming Language. Its terms are different from\
  \ \nthose of the \"Artistic License.\" \n\nPREAMBLE \n\nThe intent of this document is to\
  \ state the conditions under which a \nPackage may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder\
  \ maintains some \nsemblance of artistic control over the development of the package, \nwhile\
  \ giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute \nthe Package in a more-or-less\
  \ customary fashion, plus the right to make \nreasonable modifications. \n\nDefinitions: \n\
  \n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the \nCopyright Holder, and\
  \ derivatives of that collection of files \ncreated through textual modification. \n\n\"Standard\
  \ Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been \nmodified, or has been modified in\
  \ accordance with the wishes \nof the Copyright Holder. \n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever\
  \ is named in the copyright or \ncopyrights for the package. \n\n\"You\" is you, if you're\
  \ thinking about copying or distributing \nthis Package. \n\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is\
  \ whatever you can justify on the \nbasis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people\
  \ involved, \nand so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the \nCopyright Holder,\
  \ but only to the computing community at large \nas a market that must bear the fee.) \n\n\
  \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item \nitself, though there may\
  \ be fees involved in handling the item. \nIt also means that recipients of the item may redistribute\
  \ it \nunder the same conditions they received it. \n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim\
  \ copies of the source form of the \nStandard Version of this Package without restriction,\
  \ provided that you \nduplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\
  \ \n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications \nderived from\
  \ the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package \nmodified in such a way shall\
  \ still be considered the Standard Version. \n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this\
  \ Package in any way, provided \nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating\
  \ how and \nwhen you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the \nfollowing:\
  \ \n\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them \nFreely Available,\
  \ such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or \nan equivalent medium, or placing the\
  \ modifications on a major archive \nsite such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright\
  \ Holder to include \nyour modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. \n\nb) use\
  \ the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. \n\nc) rename any non-standard\
  \ executables so the names do not conflict \nwith standard executables, which must also be\
  \ provided, and provide \na separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\
  \ \ndocuments how it differs from the Standard Version. \n\nd) make other distribution arrangements\
  \ with the Copyright Holder. \n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object\
  \ code or \nexecutable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: \n\na) distribute\
  \ a Standard Version of the executables and library files, \ntogether with instructions (in\
  \ the manual page or equivalent) on where \nto get the Standard Version. \n\nb) accompany\
  \ the distribution with the machine-readable source of \nthe Package with your modifications.\
  \ \n\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding \nStandard Version\
  \ executables, giving the non-standard executables \nnon-standard names, and clearly documenting\
  \ the differences in manual \npages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to\
  \ get \nthe Standard Version. \n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright\
  \ Holder. \n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this \nPackage.\
  \ You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. \nYou may not charge a fee\
  \ for this Package itself. However, \nyou may distribute this Package in aggregate with other\
  \ (possibly \ncommercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software \ndistribution\
  \ provided that you do not advertise this Package as a \nproduct of your own. \n\n6. The scripts\
  \ and library files supplied as input to or produced as \noutput from the programs of this\
  \ Package do not automatically fall \nunder the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever\
  \ generated \nthem, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this \nPackage.\
  \ \n\n7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order \nto emulate\
  \ subroutines and variables of the language defined by this \nPackage shall not be considered\
  \ part of this Package, but are the \nequivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these\
  \ subroutines do \nnot change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the \nregression\
  \ tests for the language. \n\n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse\
  \ or promote \nproducts derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\
