Copyright Â© (c) 1999 by Samuel Reynolds.
Derived from the &#34;Artistic License&#34; at &#34;OpenSource.org&#34;.
Submitted to OpenSource.org for Open Source Initiative certification.

PREAMBLE

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make reasonable modifications.

DEFINITIONS

o   &#34;Package&#34; refers to the script, suite, file, or collection of scripts, 
    suites, and/or files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and to 
    derivatives of that Package created through textual modification.

o   &#34;Standard Version&#34; refers to such a Package if it has not been 
    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the 
    Copyright Holder.

o   &#34;Copyright Holder&#34; is whoever is named in the copyright statement or 
    statements for the package.

o   &#34;You&#34; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing this 
    Package.

o   &#34;Reasonable copying fee&#34; is whatever you can justify on the basis of 
    media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.  
    (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but 
    only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the 
    fee.)

o   &#34;Freely Available&#34; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, 
    though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means 
    that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same 
    conditions they received it.

TERMS

1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
    Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
    duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes, and other modifications 
    derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package 
    modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided 
    that you insert a prominent notice in each changed script, suite, or file 
    stating how and when you changed that script, suite, or file, and provided 
    that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) Use the modified Package only within your corporation or 
    organization, or retain the modified Package solely for personal use.
    
    b) Place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site 
    such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your 
    modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
    
    c) Rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict 
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a 
    separate manual page (or equivalent) for each non-standard executable 
    that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
    
    d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or 
    executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) Distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where 
    to get the Standard Version.
    
    b) Accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
    Package with your modifications.
    
    c) Accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding 
    Standard Version executables, give the non-standard executables 
    non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual 
    pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the 
    Standard Version.
    
    d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
    
5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
    Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.  
    You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may 
    distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) 
    programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution 
    provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
    
6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as 
    output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under 
    the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and 
    may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
    
7.  Scripts, suites, or programs supplied by you that depend on or 
    otherwise make use of this Package shall not be considered part of this 
    Package.
    
8.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
    products derived from this software without specific prior written 
    permission.

9.  THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &#34;AS IS&#34; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
    MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</code></pre>
