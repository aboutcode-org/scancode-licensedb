Version 1.11

THIS DOCUMENT IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT (the &#34;License Agreement&#34;) BETWEEN SENCHA INC. (&#34;We,&#34; &#34;Us&#34;) AND YOU OR THE ORGANIZATION ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE UNDERTAKING THE LICENSE DESCRIBED BELOW (&#34;You&#34;) IN RELATION TO SENCHA EXT JS AND/OR SENCHA GXT (THE &#34;Software&#34;). BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE DOWNLOADING, COPYING, INSTALLATION OR ANY OTHER USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF. THE SOFTWARE IS PROTECTED BY UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT LAWS, AS WELL AS OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AND TREATIES. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD.

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT DESCRIBES YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND ITS COMPONENTS.

1. OWNERSHIP, LICENSE GRANT

This is a license agreement and not an agreement for sale. We reserve ownership of all intellectual property rights inherent in or relating to the Software, which include, but are not limited to, all copyright, patent rights, all rights in relation to registered and unregistered trademarks (including service marks), confidential information (including trade secrets and know-how) and all rights other than those expressly granted by this License Agreement.

Subject to the payment of the fee required and subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, We grant to You a revocable, non- transferable and non-exclusive license (i) for Designated User(s) (as defined below) within Your organization to install and use the Software on any workstations used exclusively by such Designated User(s) and (ii) for You to install and use the Software in connection with unlimited domains and sub-domains on unlimited servers, solely in connection with distribution of the Software in accordance with sections 3 and 4 below. This license is not sublicensable except as explicitly set forth herein. &#34;Designated User&#34; shall mean a single distinct employee acting within the scope of their employment with You or Your consultant or contractor acting within the scope of the services they provide for You or on Your behalf for whom You have purchased a license to use the Software.

In addition to the other terms contained herein, We grant to You a revocable, non- transferable and non-exclusive license to install and use the Software on a single computer (the &#34;Trial License&#34;) strictly for Your internal evaluation and review purposes and not for production purposes. This Trial License applies only if You have registered with Us for a Trial License of the Software and shall be effective for forty-five (45) consecutive days following the date of registration (&#34;the Trial Period&#34;). You may only register for a Trial License once in any eighteen month period. You agree not to use a Trial License for any purpose other than determining whether to purchase a license to the Software. You are explicitly not permitted to distribute the Software to any user outside the Organization on whose behalf you have undertaken this license. Your rights to use the Trial License will immediately terminate upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Trial Period, or (ii) such time that You purchase a license to the Software. We reserve the right to terminate Your Trial License at any time in Our absolute and sole discretion.

2. PERMITTED USES, SOURCE CODE, MODIFICATIONS

We provide You with source code so that You can create Modifications of the original Software, where Modification means: a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file included in the original Software or previous Modifications created by You, or b) any new file that contains any part of the original Software or previous Modifications. While You retain all rights to any original work authored by You as part of the Modifications, We continue to own all copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

3. DISTRIBUTION

You may distribute the Software in any applications, frameworks, or elements (collectively referred to as an &#34;Application&#34; or &#34;Applications&#34;) that you develop using the Software in accordance with this License Agreement, provided that such distribution does not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 4 of this License Agreement. You must not remove, obscure or interfere with any copyright, acknowledgment, attribution, trademark, warning or disclaimer statement affixed to, incorporated in or otherwise applied in connection with the Software.

You are required to ensure that the Software is not reused by or with any applications other than those with which You distribute it as permitted herein. For example, if You install the Software on a customerâ€™s server, that customer is not permitted to use the Software independently of Your application, and must be informed as such.

You will not owe Us any royalties for Your distribution of the Software in accordance with this License Agreement.

4. PROHIBITED USES

You may not, without Our prior written consent, redistribute the Software or Modifications other than by including the Software or a portion thereof within Your own product, which must have substantially different functionality than the Software or Modifications and must not allow any third party to use the Software or Modifications, or any portions thereof, for software development or application development purposes. You are explicitly not allowed to redistribute the Software or Modifications as part of any product that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder or any product that is intended for use by software, application, or website developers or designers. You are not allowed to redistribute any part of the Software documentation. You may not change or remove the copyright notice from any of the files included in the Software or Modifications.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY YOU USE THE SOFTWARE FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS INTENDED FOR SOFTWARE OR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.

The Open Source version of the Software (&#34;GPL Version&#34;) is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License versions 3.0 (&#34;GPL&#34;) and not under this License Agreement. If You, or another third party, has, at any time, developed all (or any portions of) the Application(s) using the GPL Version, You may not combine such development work with the Software and must license such Application(s) (or any portions derived there from) under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3, a copy of which is located at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

5. TERMINATION

This License Agreement and Your right to use the Software and Modifications will terminate immediately without notice if You fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. Upon termination, You agree to immediately cease using and destroy the Software or Modifications, including all accompanying documents. The provisions of sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 will survive any termination of this License Agreement.

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT TECHNICALLY PRACTICABLE FOR US TO DO SO.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES

8. VERIFICATION

Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that You are using the Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the License Agreement, then You shall pay Our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, You agree to pay Us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, We reserve the right, at Our sole option, to terminate the licenses for the Software.
