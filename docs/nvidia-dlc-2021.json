LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license, NVIDIA hereby grants you a\nnon-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except\nas expressly provided in this license) to:\n\na. Install and use copies of the CONTAINER, and modify and create derivative\nworks of samples or example source code delivered in the CONTAINER (if\napplicable), to develop and test services and applications,\n\nb. Deploy the CONTAINER on infrastructure you own or lease to offer a service to\nthird parties, without distributing the CONTAINER or exposing the NVIDIA APIs in\nthe CONTAINER directly to such service users, and\n\nc. Develop and extend the CONTAINER to create a Compatible (as defined below)\nderived CONTAINER that includes the entire CONTAINER plus other software with\nprimary functionality, to develop and compile applications, and distribute such\nderived CONTAINER to run applications, subject to the distribution requirements\nindicated in this license. As used in this section, \u201cCompatible\u201d means that\nextensions to the CONTAINER must not adversely affect the functionality of the\nother components in the CONTAINER.\n\n2. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. For purposes of this Section 2, the term\n\u201cdistribution\u201d also means the deployment of CONTAINERS in a service or an\napplication for third parties to access over the internet. These are the\ndistribution requirements for you to exercise the grants above:\n\na. A service or an application must have material additional functionality,\nbeyond the included portions of the CONTAINER.\n\nb. The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works\nof source code distributed: \u201cThis software contains source code provided by\nNVIDIA Corporation.\u201d\n\nc. You agree to distribute the CONTAINER subject to the terms at least as\nprotective as the terms of this license, including (without limitation) terms\nrelating to the license grant, license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA\u2019s\nintellectual property rights.

The CONTAINER may run on any computing system with or without NVIDIA GPUs,\nexcept for the NVIDIA proprietary software (such as CUDA and TensorRT software)\nin the CONTAINER which is licensed only to run on systems with NVIDIA GPUs. The\nNVIDIA proprietary software in the CONTAINER may be present on systems without\nNVIDIA GPUs, as long as it is not running on such systems. For components\ngoverned by open source software licenses, see the information in the\n\u201cComponents Under Other Licenses\u201d section below.\n\nb. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright\nor other proprietary notices from any portion of the CONTAINER or copies of the\nCONTAINER.\n\nc.
