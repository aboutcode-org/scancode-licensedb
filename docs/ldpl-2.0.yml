  \ is displayed in the reproduction. Commercial redistribution is permitted and encouraged.\
  \ Thirty days advance notice via email to the author(s) of redistribution is appreciated,\
  \ to give the authors time to provide updated documents.\n\n        REQUIREMENTS OF MODIFIED\
  \ WORKS\n\n        All modified documents, including translations, anthologies, and partial\
  \ documents, must meet the following requirements:\n\n            The modified version must\
  \ be labeled as such.\n            The person making the modifications must be identified.\n\

  \ without the document being considered \"modified\" for the purposes of this section.\n\n\
  \        Mere aggregation of LDP documents with other documents or programs on the same media\
  \ shall not cause this license to apply to those other works.\n\n        All translations,\

  \ more restrictive license terms than these, except that you may require distributors to make\
  \ the resulting document available in source format.\n\n        LDP documents are available\
