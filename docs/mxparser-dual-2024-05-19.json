For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number of software developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other professionals who use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of workstations is not the number of copies of your end-product that you distribute to your end-users.\n\nBy purchasing the COMMERCIAL LICENSE, you only pay for the number of workstations, while the number of copies/users of your final product (delivered to your end-users) is not limited.\n\nBelow are some examples to help you select the right license size:\n\nExample 1: Single Workstation License\n\nOnly one developer works on the development of your application. You do not use separate environments for testing, meaning you design, create, test, and compile your final application on one environment. In this case, you need a license for a single workstation.\n\nExample 2: Up to 5 Workstations License\n\nTwo developers are working on the development of your application. Additionally, one tester conducts tests in a separate environment. You use three workstations in total, so you need a license for up to five workstations.\n\nExample 3: Up to 20 Workstations License\n\nTen developers are working on the development of your application. Additionally, five testers conduct tests in separate environments. You use fifteen workstations in total, so you need a license for up to twenty workstations.\n\nExample 4: Site License\n\nSeveral dozen developers and testers work on the development of your application using multiple environments. You have a large, multi-disciplinary team involved in creating your solution. As your team is growing and you want to avoid licensing limitations, the best choice would be a site license.\n\nUPGRADE POLICY\n\nThe PRODUCT is versioned according to the following convention:\n\n[MAJOR] . [MINOR] . [PATCH]\n\n    COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders can install and use the updated version for bug fixes free of charge, i.e., if you have purchased a license for the [MAJOR] . [MINOR] version (e.g., 5.0), you can freely install all releases specified in the [PATCH] version (e.g., 5.0.2). The license terms remain unchanged after the update.\n    COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders for the [MAJOR] . [MINOR] version (e.g., 5.0) can install and use the updated version [MAJOR] . [MINOR + 1] free of charge, i.e., plus one release in the [MINOR] range (e.g., 5.1). The license terms remain unchanged after the update.\n    COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders who wish to upgrade their version but are not eligible for the free upgrade, can claim a discount when purchasing the upgrade. For this purpose, please contact us via email.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nTHIS PRODUCT IS PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR & PUBLISHER \u201cAS IS\u201d AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
