  \ read the license carefully---it is somewhat like the GNU General Public License, but there\
  \ are several conditions in it that differ from what you may be used to. If you have any questions,\
  \ please email the LDP coordinator, Guylhem Aznar.\n\nNote: All Linux Documentation Project\
  \ manuals are copyrighted by their respective authors. THEY ARE NOT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n\
  \nThe Linux Documentation Project manuals (guides) may be reproduced and distributed in whole\
  \ or in part, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The copyright notice above and this\
  \ permission notice must be preserved complete on all complete or partial copies.\n    Any\
  \ translation or derivative work of Linux Installation and Getting Started must be approved\
  \ by the author in writing before distribution.\n    If you distribute Linux Installation\
  \ and Getting Started in part, instructions for obtaining the complete version of this manual\
  \ must be included, and a means for obtaining a complete version provided.\n    Small portions\
  \ may be reproduced as illustrations for reviews or quotes in other works without this permission\

  \ in Linux Installation and Getting Started is placed under the GNU General Public License,\
  \ available via anonymous FTP from the GNU archive site.\n\nPlease read the LDP Manifesto\
  \ for further information. If you are authoring a work, the Manifesto provides a sample copyright\
  \ (derived from the previous area) to utilize, if you so desire. There is also a section devoted\
  \ to Publishing LDP Manuals. If you're a publishing company interested in distributing any\
  \ of the LDP manuals, please read that particular section.\n\nIf you have any questions, please\
  \ email the LDP coordinator, Guylhem Aznar.\n"
