Motivation and Preamble

The Siesta program has been devised for its general use in research
within the academic community. Some conditions have been defined for
the use, distribution, and modification of Siesta, which the authors
consider fair and within the common fair practices in the academic
community.

1. Definitions

&#34;The Authors&#34; are:

    * Emilio Artacho, University of Cambridge, and IkerBasque and
    CIC-Nanogune, San Sebastián * José María Cela,
    Barcelona Supercomputing Center * Julian Gale, Curtin University
    of Technology, Perth * Alberto García, ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona *
    Javier Junquera, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander * Pablo
    Ordejón, CIN2-CSIC, Barcelona * Daniel Sánchez-Portal, Centro
    de Física de Materiales, CSIC-UPV/EHU, San Sebastián * 
    José M. Soler, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid

Although we, the Authors, acknowledge that a limited number of
auxiliary subroutines were written by (or are based on previous
subroutines written by) other authors consider that the implementation
of all the basic algorithms of the Siesta program is ours.

The Siesta team (&#34;the Developers&#34;) are the Authors and:

    * Richard M. Martin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

&#34;The Copyright-Holder&#34; is the set of Authors.

The valid distributors of the Siesta package (&#34;The Distributors&#34;) are
the Developers as specified above.

&#34;The Siesta package&#34; is the suite of software, including the Siesta
code itself, but also all other software, documentation, scripts, and
ancillary support material distributed as a single entity. This
Licence covers the entirety of said data.

The Licensee is the person (never an institution) to whom the Siesta
package is distributed (under the terms of this Licence) by the
Distributors; they are bound by this agreement.

2. NO WARRANTY

There is no warranty for any part of the Siesta package. The Siesta
package is provided by the Distributors &#34;as-is&#34; without warranty of
any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the
implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose. In no event shall the Distributors be liable for any direct,
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages
(including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or
services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption)
however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract,
strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising
in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the
possibility of such damage. The entire risk as to the quality or
performance of the program, or any action the Licensee may take based
on the output of any part of the Siesta package, is with the Licensee.

3. Limitation of Usage

The use of the Siesta package under the present Licence is restricted
solely to members of academic institutions (including universities and
non-military public research laboratories) and to academic purposes,
i.e., leading to open publication of results, with neither withhold of
information nor intentional delay in publication. Notwithstanding
these general definitions, the Authors reserve the exclusive right to
determine what purposes and persons are elegible for using the
Siesta package under this Licence, and to withhold the right to use
the software where they are not satisfied that either condition is
fulfilled.

The Licensee is hereby provided with a non-exclusive, royalty-free
right to use any part of the Siesta package, and to display, publish,
perform, or otherwise use results obtained by use of the Siesta
package in any form, subject to the restriction that in any paper or
other academic publication containing results wholly or partially
derived from the results of use of the Siesta package, the following
papers must be cited in the normal manner:

   1. Self-consistent order-N density-functional calculations for very
   large systems, P. Ordejón, E. Artacho and J. M. Soler, Phys. Rev. B
   (Rapid Comm.) 53, R10441 (1996).  
   
   2. The Siesta method for ab initio order-N materials simulation,
   José M. Soler, Emilio Artacho, Julian D. Gale, Alberto García,
   Javier Junquera, Pablo Ordejón and Daniel Sánchez-Portal, J. Phys.:
   Condens. Matter 14, 2745 (2002).

Other papers relevant to the Siesta package and method should be cited
as best scientific practice dictates.

Licensees are recommended to send reference to the Developers of any
publication containing results wholly or partially derived from the
results of use of the Siesta package.

The above-mentioned right to use the code is extensive to the members
of the research group of the Licensee as long as the use is in
collaboration with the Licensee leading to co-authored publication(s).

4. Support

The present Licence does not imply support services of any kind to the
Licensee by the Distributors, including, but not limited to,
installation, compilation and use of the software in the package.

5. Modification

Licensees are permitted to modify Siesta for their own private use; in
any paper containing results wholly or partially derived from the use
of a modified version of Siesta, the authors are required to state
that a privately modified version of Siesta is used, and satisfy the
conditions of use stated above.

The Developers encourage Licensees to submit their modifications of
the Siesta package to them, so that the Siesta package does not fork,
and furthermore so that the package can be improved for all
users. Licensees can thereby benefit from the ulterior developments of
Siesta.

To this end, the Developers wish to encourage Licensees to make any
modifications to the Siesta package in as modular a fashion as
possible: for example, interacting via files, or via well-defined
interface calls. This permits maintenance of these modifications as a
separate entity in many cases, and may allow their separation from
Siesta and distribution as a separate piece of software: in that case,
such software is not subject to this Licence, and the authors of the
separate software are free to choose any licensing terms they desire.

However, if a given modification must be incorporated directly into
the Siesta package, the author(s) of any such modifications must
provide a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable license to the 
Copyright-Holder, to further modify their modifications 
(&#34;the Contributed Code&#34;) as may prove necessary for the
future development of Siesta, and to distribute the Contributed Code
(in its original or any later modified form) as part of the Siesta
package.

The Developers, in the interests of maintaining the efficiency of the
Siesta package and the modularity of its code base, actively encourage
all those considering modifications to the Siesta package to discuss
their planned modifications with the Developers beforehand.

6. Redistribution

The authors reserve the exclusive right to distribute the Siesta
package. Licensees have no right to distribute the Siesta package, a
modified or alternative version thereof, or any other program making
direct use of parts of the Siesta package, without the prior written
consent of the Distributors.

7. All Other Rights

All other rights not explicitly mentioned in this document are
reserved. In particular, the Authors reserve all rights to resolve any
and all conflicts arising in the development and distribution policies
of the Siesta package.

Without accepting the Licence, a prospective Licensee does not have the
right to use or modify the Siesta package.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
Licence document, but changing it is not permitted.</code></pre>
