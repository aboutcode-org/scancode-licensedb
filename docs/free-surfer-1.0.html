If you do not agree to such terms and conditions, you have no right to contribute your Contribution, or to download, copy, modify, display, distribute or use the Software.

PART A. CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

License to MGH with Right to Sublicense (&#34;Contribution Agreement&#34;)

As used in this Contribution Agreement, &#34;you&#34; means the individual contributing the Contribution to FreeSurfer and the institution or entity which employs or is otherwise affiliated with such individual in connection with such Contribution.

This Contribution Agreement applies to all Contributions made to FreeSurfer, including without limitation Contributions made prior to the date of first publication of this Agreement. If at any time you make a Contribution to FreeSurfer, you represent that (i) you are legally authorized and entitled to make such Contribution and to grant all licenses granted in this Contribution Agreement with respect to such Contribution; (ii) if your Contribution includes any patient data, all such data is de-identified in accordance with U.S. confidentiality and security laws and requirements, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its regulations, and your disclosure of such data for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement is properly authorized and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and (iii) you have preserved in the Contribution all applicable attributions, copyright notices and licenses for any third party software or data included in the Contribution.

Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you reserve all right, title and interest in your Contribution.

You hereby grant to MGH, with the right to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, make derivative works of, display and distribute the Contribution. If your Contribution is protected by patent, you hereby grant to MGH, with the right to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under your interest in patent rights covering the Contribution, to make, have made, use, sell and otherwise transfer your Contribution, alone or in combination with any other code.

You acknowledge and agree that MGH may incorporate your Contribution into FreeSurfer and may make FreeSurfer available to members of the public on an open source basis under terms substantially in accordance with the Software License set forth in Part B of this Agreement. You further acknowledge and agree that MGH shall have no liability arising in connection with claims resulting from your breach of any of the terms of this Agreement.

YOU WARRANT THAT TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE YOUR CONTRIBUTION DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY CODE THAT REQURES OR PRESCRIBES AN &#34;OPEN SOURCE LICENSE&#34; FOR DERIVATIVE WORKS (by way of non-limiting example, the GNU General Public License or other so-called &#34;reciprocal&#34; license that requires any derived work to be licensed under the GNU General Public License or other &#34;open source license&#34;).
