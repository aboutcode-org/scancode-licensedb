ยง2 Grant of usage rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and compliance with the
provisions of this License, You are hereby granted by each Contributor, insofar
as applicable to the respective Subject Matter of the License the

- royalty-free and non-exclusive,
- sub-licensable for commercial and non-commercial purposes,
- worldwide and perpetual,
- irrevocable and non-terminable

right to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly

Works in any form. This right of use includes but is not limited to the right

- to use the Subject Matter of the License in any hardware and software
  environment (with regard to the software and data components), in particular
  to store or load it permanently or temporarily, to display it and run it,
  including to the extent reproductions are necessary to that end,
- to otherwise modify, interpret, edit or redesign it,
- to store, reproduce, exhibit, publish, distribute it in tangible or intangible

  to make the software and data components of the Subject Matter of the License
  available in Source or Object form to users of the aforementioned databases,
  networks and online services for research and retrieval purposes,
- to allow third parties to use or operate it,
- to use it for own purposes but also to provide services to third parties,
- to distribute it

in its original or modified, interpreted, edited or redesigned form.

The foregoing right of use relates to the Subject Matter of the License, in
particular to its Source and Object form of software components (including
design rights, where applicable).

ยง3 Grant of patent license

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and compliance with the
provisions of this License, You are hereby granted by each Contributor a 
- royalty-free and non-exclusive,
- worldwide and perpetual,
- irrevocable (with the exception of the restrictions set out in this Section 3)

patent license in all rights deriving from the patents, owned and licensable by
the Contributor at the time of the submission of the Contribution, to

- produce,
- have produced,
- use,
- offer for sale,
- sell,
- import and otherwise transfer

the Subject Matter of the License.

However, said patent license shall cover only those rights deriving from the
patents of the respective Contributors which are indispensable in order not to
infringe that patent and only to the extent that the use of the Contributorโs
respective Contributions, whether alone or in combination with other
Contributions of the Contributors or any third parties together with the Subject
Matter of the License for which these Contributions were submitted, would
otherwise infringe that patent. The grant of license shall not include rights
deriving from the patents which may in future become necessary for their lawful
use due to subsequent modifications to the Subject Matter or Contributions made
by third parties after the original submission.

In the event that You institute patent litigation against any entity or person
(including a counterclaim or countersuit in a legal action), alleging that the
Subject Matter of the License or a Contribution incorporated or contained
therein constitutes patent infringement or indirect infringement, all patent
licenses which have been granted to You under this License for the Subject
Matter of the License as well as this License itself shall be deemed terminated
as of the date on which the action is filed.

ยง4 Distribution

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Subject Matter of the License or
Derivative Works on any medium, with or without modifications (with regard to
software components in Source or Object form), provided that You comply with
the following rules:

- You must provide all other recipients of the Subject Matter of the License or
  of Derivative Works with a copy of this License and inform them that the
  Subject Matter of the License was originally licensed under this License.
- You must ensure that modified files contain prominent notices indicating that
  You have modified the files.
- You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices in
  the Subject Matter of the License in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  You distribute, with the exception of those notices that do not pertain to any
  part of the Derivative Works.

You may add Your own copyright notices to Your modifications and state any
additional or different license conditions and conditions for the use,
reproduction or distribution of Your modifications or for those Derivative Works
as a whole, provided that Your use, reproduction and distribution of the work
complies with the terms and conditions set out in this License in all other
respects.

ยง5 Submission of Contributions

Unless expressly stated otherwise, every Contribution that You have
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Subject Matter of the License is
subject to this License without any additional terms or conditions applying.
Irrespective of the above, none of the terms or conditions contained herein may
be interpreted to supersede or modify the terms or conditions of any separate
licensing agreement that You may have concluded with a Licensor for such
Contributions, such as a so-called &#34;Contributor License Agreement&#34; (CLA).

ยง6 Trademarks

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks or product names of the Licensor(s) or of a Contributor.

ยง7 Limited warranty

This License is granted free of charge and thus constitutes a gift. Accordingly,
any warranty is excluded. The Subject Matter of the License is a work in
progress; it is constantly being improved by countless Contributors. The Subject
Matter of the License is not complete and may therefore contain errors (&#34;bugs&#34;)
or additional patents of Contributors or third parties, as is inherent in this
type of development.

ยง8 Limitation of liability

Except in cases of intentional and grossly negligent conduct, the Contributors,
their legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be
liable for direct or indirect, material or immaterial loss or damage of any kind
arising from the License or the use of the Subject Matter of the License; this
applies, among other things, but not exclusively, to loss of goodwill, loss of
production, computer failures or errors, loss of data or economic loss or
damage, even if the Contributor has been notified of the possibility of such
loss or damage. Irrespective of the above, the Licensor shall only be liable
within the scope of statutory product liability to the extent that the
respective provisions are applicable to the Subject Matter of the License or the
Contribution.

Except in cases of intentional conduct, the Contributors, their legal
representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for any
infringement of third-party patent or intellectual property rights arising from
the Contributions nor do they warrant that the Contributions are accurate,
devoid of mistakes, complete and/or fit for any particular purpose.

ยง9 Provision of warranties or assumption of additional liability in the event of
distribution of the Subject Matter of the License

In the event of distribution of the Subject Matter of the License or Derivative
Works, You are free to accept support, warranty, indemnity or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License and to charge a fee in
return. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

ยง10 Applicable law

This License is governed by German law, excluding its conflict of laws
provisions and the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods (CISG).
