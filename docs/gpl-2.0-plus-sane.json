Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on\n   account of linking the SANE library code into it.\n\n   This exception does not, however, invalidate any other reasons why\n   the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public\n   License.\n\n   If you submit changes to SANE to the maintainers to be included in\n   a subsequent release, you agree by submitting the changes that\n   those changes may be distributed with this exception intact.\n\n   If you write modifications of your own for SANE, it is your choice\n   whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.\n   If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice."
