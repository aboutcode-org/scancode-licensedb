text: "GNU EMACS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t    (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)\n\n Copyright (C) 1985,\
  \ 1987, 1988 Richard M. Stallman\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
  \ of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also\n use this wording to make\
  \ the terms for other programs.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep\
  \ you at the\nmercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended\
  \ to give everyone the right to share GNU Emacs.  To make\nsure that you get the rights we\
  \ want you to have, we need to make\nrestrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights\
  \ or to ask you\nto surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n  Specifically,\
  \ we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of Emacs, that you receive\
  \ source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that you can change Emacs or use pieces\
  \ of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure\
  \ that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.\
  \  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of Emacs, you must give the recipients all the rights\
  \ that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.\
  \  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain\
  \ that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for GNU Emacs.  If Emacs is\nmodified\
  \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know\nthat what they have is not\
  \ what we distributed, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on our\
  \ reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Richard Stallman and the Free Software Fundation,\nInc.)\
  \ make the following terms which say what you must do to be\nallowed to distribute or change\
  \ GNU Emacs.\n\n\t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
  \ of GNU Emacs source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\
  \ and\nappropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice \"Copyright\n(C) 1988 Free\
  \ Software Foundation, Inc.\" (or with whatever year is\nappropriate); keep intact the notices\
  \ on all files that refer to this\nLicense Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and\
  \ give any\nother recipients of the GNU Emacs program a copy of this License\nAgreement along\
  \ with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee\nfor the physical act of transferring\
  \ a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of GNU Emacs source code or\nany portion\
  \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under\nthe terms of Paragraph 1 above,\
  \ provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent\
  \ notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b)\
  \ cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part\
  \ contains or is a derivative of GNU Emacs\n    or any part thereof, to be licensed at no\
  \ charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n\
  \    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n    warranty protection\
  \ to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) if the modified program serves\
  \ as a text editor, cause it when\n    started running in the simplest and usual way, to print\
  \ an\n    announcement including a valid copyright notice \"Copyright (C)\n    1988 Free Software\
  \ Foundation, Inc.\" (or with the year that is\n    appropriate), saying that there is no\
  \ warranty (or else, saying\n    that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\
  \ the\n    program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a\n    copy of\
  \ this License Agreement.\n\n    d) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act\
  \ of\n    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in\
  \ exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or\
  \ its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other\
  \ program under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute GNU Emacs (or\
  \ a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under\
  \ the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\
  \n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which\
  \ must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany\
  \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free\
  \ (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n  \
  \  corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2\
  \ above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n  \
  \  corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for\
  \ noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable\
  \ form alone.)\n\nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\n\
  all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\nsource code for\
  \ modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\noperating system on which the executable\
  \ file runs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs\nexcept\
  \ as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense,\
  \ distribute or transfer GNU Emacs is void and\nyour rights to use GNU Emacs under this License\
  \ agreement shall be\nautomatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\n\
  software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have\ntheir licenses terminated\
  \ so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. If you wish to incorporate parts\
  \ of GNU Emacs into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write\
  \ to the Free Software\nFoundation.  We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be\
  \ stated\nhere, but we will often permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving\
  \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and\
  \ reuse of software.\n\nYour comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\n\
  software are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n675 Mass Ave, Cambridge,\
  \ MA 02139, or call (617) 876-3296.\n\n\t\t\t   NO WARRANTY\n\n  BECAUSE GNU EMACS IS LICENSED\
  \ FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY\nNO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\
  \ STATE LAW.  EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC,\nRICHARD\
  \ M. STALLMAN AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE GNU EMACS \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\
  \ EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\
  \ AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY\nAND PERFORMANCE\
  \ OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE GNU EMACS\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\
  \ COST OF ALL NECESSARY\nSERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED\
  \ BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL FREE SOFTWARE\nFOUNDATION, INC., RICHARD M. STALLMAN, AND/OR ANY\
  \ OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\nMODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE GNU EMACS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO\
  \ YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
  \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT\
  \ LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD\
  \ PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH PROGRAMS NOT DISTRIBUTED BY\nFREE SOFTWARE\
  \ FOUNDATION, INC.) THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
  \ DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY\nOTHER PARTY."
