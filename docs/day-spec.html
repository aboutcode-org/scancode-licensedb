All rights reserved.

NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS

1. License for Purposes of Evaluation and Developing Applications.
Licensor hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
worldwide, limited license (without the right to sublicense), under
Licensor&#39;s applicable intellectual property rights to view, download,
use and reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal
evaluation. This includes developing applications intended to run on an
implementation of the Specification provided that such applications do
not themselves implement any portion(s) of the Specification.

2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Licensor
also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to
sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions
of subsection 4 below, patent rights it may have covering the
Specification to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation
of the Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification
including all its required interfaces and functionality; (b) does not
modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or
include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields
or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those
required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being
implemented; and (c) passes the Technology Compatibility Kit (including
satisfying the requirements of the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such
Specification (&#34;Compliant Implementation&#34;). In addition, the foregoing
license is expressly conditioned on your not acting outside its scope.
No license is granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for
example, modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of your
fair use rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).

3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c) from
the previous paragraph or any other particular &#34;pass through&#34; requirements
in any license You grant concerning the use of your Independent
Implementation or products derived from it. However, except with respect
to Independent Implementations (and products derived from them) that
satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You may neither:
(a) grant or otherwise pass through to your licensees any licenses under
Licensor&#39;s applicable intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your
licensees to make any claims concerning their implementation&#39;s compliance
with the Specification.

4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses. With respect to any patent
claims covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above that
would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the
Specification, such license is conditioned upon your offering on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from
You, a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license
under Your patent rights that are or would be infringed by all technically
feasible implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and
use a Compliant Implementation.

5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: &#34;Independent
Implementation&#34; shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
neither derives from any of Licensor&#39;s source code or binary code
materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from
Licensor, includes any of Licensor&#39;s source code or binary code materials;
&#34;Licensor Name Space&#34; shall mean the public class or interface
declarations whose names begin with &#34;java&#34;, &#34;javax&#34;, &#34;javax.jcr&#34; or their
equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Licensor
through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or
replacements thereof; and &#34;Technology Compatibility Kit&#34; or &#34;TCK&#34; shall
mean the test suite and accompanying TCK User&#39;s Guide provided by
Licensor which corresponds to the particular version of the Specification
being tested.

6. Termination. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
from Licensor if you fail to comply with any material provision of or act
outside the scope of the licenses granted above.

7. Trademarks. No right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks,
service marks, or trade names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is
a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and
other countries.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Specification is provided &#34;AS IS&#34;.
LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT (INCLUDING AS A
CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIFICATION), OR
THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE.
This document does not represent any commitment to release or implement
any portion of the Specification in any product.

The Specification could include technical inaccuracies or typographical
errors. Changes are periodically added to the information therein; these
changes will be incorporated into new versions of the Specification, if
any. Licensor may make improvements and/or changes to the product(s)
and/or the program(s) described in the Specification at any time. Any
use of such changes in the Specification will be governed by the
then-current license for the applicable version of the Specification.

9. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
FURNISHING, PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE OF THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN
IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10. Report. If you provide Licensor with any comments or suggestions in
connection with your use of the Specification (&#34;Feedback&#34;), you hereby:
(i) agree that such Feedback is provided on a non-proprietary and
non-confidential basis, and (ii) grant Licensor a perpetual,
non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, irrevocable license, with the
right to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, to
incorporate, disclose, and use without limitation the Feedback for any
purpose related to the Specification and future versions,
implementations, and test suites thereof.

[Addendum to the Day Specification License]

In addition to the permissions granted under the Specification
License, Day Management AG hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
license to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute unmodified copies of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR 1.0) Java Archive (JAR)
file (&#34;jcr-1.0.jar&#34;) and to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer said file on its own or
as part of a larger work that makes use of the JCR API.

With respect to any patent claims covered by this license
that would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations
of the Specification, such license is conditioned upon your
offering on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,
to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent rights
that are or would be infringed by all technically feasible
implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute
and use a Compliant Implementation.</code></pre>
