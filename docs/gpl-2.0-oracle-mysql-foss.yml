  MySQL FOSS License Exception

  We want free and open source software applications under certain licenses to be
  able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL Connector (specified GPL-licensed MySQL
  client libraries) despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are
  compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

  Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and conditions of the GPLv2
  as applied to these client libraries, which are identified and described in more
  detail in the FOSS License Exception at
  <http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>

  This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.
  OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
