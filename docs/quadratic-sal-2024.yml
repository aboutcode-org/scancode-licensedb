  \ remedies under this License are cumulative. Each party\nacknowledges and agrees that any\
  \ actual or threatened breach of Sections 3.1, or\n3.2 will constitute immediate, irreparable\
  \ harm to the non-breaching party for\nwhich monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy,\
  \ that injunctive relief is\nan appropriate remedy for such breach, and that if granted, the\
  \ breaching party\nagrees to waive any bond that would otherwise be required. If any legal\
  \ action\nis brought by a party to enforce this License, the prevailing party will be\nentitled\

  \ be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of\nsuch provision on any other occasion.\n\
  \n7.7  Severability. If any provision of this License is, for any reason, held to\nbe unenforceable,\
  \ the other provisions of this License will be unimpaired, and\nthe invalid or unenforceable\
  \ provision will be deemed modified so that it is\nvalid and enforceable to the maximum extent\
  \ permitted by law (unless such\nmodification is not permitted by law, in which case such\
  \ provision will be\ndisregarded).\n\n7.8  Entire License. This License constitutes the final\
  \ and entire agreement\nbetween the parties regarding the subject hereof and supersedes all\
  \ other\nagreements, whether written or oral, between the parties concerning such subject\n\
  matter. No amendment to this License will be effective unless in writing and\nsigned by the\
  \ party to be charged."
