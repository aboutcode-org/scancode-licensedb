As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part
or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms
of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator
using the skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.
Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself,
you may (at your option) remove this special exception, which will cause
the skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under
the GNU General Public License without this special exception.

This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
version 2.2 of Bison.
