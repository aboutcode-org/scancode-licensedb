  "text": "Nmap Public Source License Version 0.92\nFor more information on this license, see https://nmap.org/npsl/\n\n0. Preamble\n\nThe intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change\nthe software regulated by this license under the open source model. It\nalso includes a Contributor Agreement and disclaims any warranty on\nCovered Software. Proprietary software companies wishing to use or\nincorporate Covered Software within their programs must contact\nLicensor to purchase a separate license. Open source developers who\nwish to incorporate parts of Covered Software into free software with\nconflicting licenses may write Licensor to request a waiver of terms.\n\nIf the Nmap Project (directly or through one of its commercial\nlicensing customers) has granted you additional rights to Nmap or Nmap\nOEM, those additional rights take precedence where they conflict with\nthe terms of this license agreement.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\nmatter hereof. It contains the license terms themselves, but not the\nreasoning behind them or detailed explanations. For further\ninformation about this License, see https://nmap.org/npsl/ . That page\nmakes a good faith attempt to explain this License, but it does not\nand can not modify its governing terms in any way.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n* \"Contribution\" means any work of authorship, including the original\n  version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work\n  or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to\n  Licensor by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity\n  authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the\n  purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of\n  electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or\n  its representatives, including but not limited to communication on\n  electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, web sites,\n  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n  designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a\n  Contribution.\"\n\n* \"Contributor\" means Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on\n  behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n  subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n* \"Covered Software\" means the work of authorship, whether in Source\n  or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n\n* \"Derivative Work\" or \"Collective Work\" means any work, whether in\n  Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work\n  and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or\n  other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of\n  authorship. It includes software as described in Section 3 of this\n  License.\n\n* \"Executable\" means Covered Software in any form other than Source Code.\n\n* \"Externally Deploy\" means to Deploy the Covered Software in any way\n  that may be accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to\n  provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way to\n  deliver any content to anyone other than You, whether the Covered\n  Software is distributed to those parties, made available as an\n  application intended for use over a computer network, or used to\n  provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than\n  You.\n\n* \"GPL\" means the GNU General Public License Version 2, as published\n  by the Free Software Foundation and provided in Exhibit A.\n\n* \"Legal Entity\" means the union of the acting entity and all other\n  entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n  \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n* \"License\" means this document, including Exhibits.\n\n* \"Licensor\" means Insecure.Com LLC and its successors and assigns.\n\n* \"Main License Body\" means all of the terms of this document,\n  excluding Exhibits.\n\n* \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising\n  permissions granted by this License.\n\n2. General Terms\n\nCovered Software is licensed to you under the terms of the GPL\n(Exhibit A), with all the exceptions, clarifications, and additions\nnoted in this Main License Body. Where the terms in this Main License\nBody conflict in any way with the GPL, the Main License Body terms\nshall take precedence. These additional terms mean that You may not\ndistribute Covered Software or Derivative Works under plain GPL terms\nwithout special permission from Licensor.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License. However, nothing else\ngrants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or\ndistributing the software (or any work based on the software), You\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\nand conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by\nclicking the Accept button or downloading the software.\n\n3. Derivative Works\n\nThis License (including the GPL portion) places important restrictions\non derived works. Licensor interprets that term quite broadly. To\navoid any misunderstandings, we consider software to constitute a\n\"derivative work\" of Covered Software for the purposes of this license\nif it does any of the following:\n\n* Integrates source code from Covered Software\n\n* Reads or includes Covered Software data files, such as nmap-os-db or\n  nmap-service-probes.\n\n* Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the\n  results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which\n  will execute anything you tell them to).\n\n* Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer. The\n  installers produced by InstallShield are an example of\n  this. Including Nmap with other software in compressed or archival\n  form does not trigger this provision, provided appropriate open\n  source decompression or de-archiving software is widely available\n  for no charge. For the purposes of this license, an installer is\n  considered to include Covered Software even if it actually retrieves\n  a copy of Covered Software from another source during runtime (such\n  as by downloading it from the Internet).\n\n* Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the\n  above\n\n* Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.\n  This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify Licensor's\n  intentions with some common examples. Distribution of any works\n  which meet these criteria must be under the terms of this license\n  (including this Main License Body and GPL), with no additional\n  conditions or restrictions. They must abide by all restrictions that\n  the GPL places on derivative or collective works, including the\n  requirements for distributing their source code and allowing\n  royalty-free redistribution.\n\n4. Contributor Agreement (Grant of Copyright and Patent Licenses)\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\nto reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly\nperform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and such\nDerivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants to You and Licensor a perpetual,\nworldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except\nas stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,\noffer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where\nsuch license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such\nContributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\nalone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to\nwhich such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent\nlitigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim\nin a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated\nwithin the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this\nLicense for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation\nis filed.\n\nContributors may impose different terms on their Contributions by\nstating those terms in writing at the time the Contribution is\nmade. Contributors may withhold all authority from Licensor to\nincorporate submissions by conspicuously marking or otherwise\ndesignating them in writing as \"Not a Contribution\" at the time they\nmake the work available.\n\n5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\nprovides the Covered Software (and each Contributor provides its\nContributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\nOF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nany warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\nMERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using or\nredistributing the Covered Software and assume any risks associated\nwith Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\nIn no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in\nwriting, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including\nany direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of\nany character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or\ninability to use the Covered Software (including but not limited to\ndamages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\nmalfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even\nif such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n6. External Deployment\n\nIf You Externally Deploy Covered Software, such as hosting a website\ndesigned to execute Nmap scans for users, the system and its\ndocumentation must, if technically feasible, prominently display a\nnotice stating that the system uses the Nmap Security Scanner to\nperform its tasks. If technically feasible, the notice must contain a\nhyperlink to https://nmap.org/ or provide that URL in the text.\n\n7. Trademarks\n\nThis License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\ntrademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as\nrequired for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of\nthe Covered Software.\n\n8. Termination for Patent Action\n\nThis License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the\ndate You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Covered Software\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an\naction alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Covered\nSoftware with other software or hardware.\n\n9. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of Washington and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America,\nexcluding the jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any\nlitigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor\nrelating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal\njurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within\nthat District with respect to this License. The application of the\nUnited Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\nGoods is expressly excluded.\n\n10. Npcap and the Official Nmap Windows Builds\n\nThe official Windows Nmap builds includes the Npcap driver and library\n(https://npcap.org) for packet capture and transmission on\nWindows. That software is under its own separate license terms rather\nthan this license. Therefore anyone wishing to use or redistribute\nboth pieces of software must comply with both licenses. Since Npcap\ndoes not allow for redistribution without special permission, the\nofficial Nmap Windows builds which include Npcap may not be\nredistributed without special permission. Such permission can be\nrequested by email to sales@nmap.com.\n\n11. Permission to link with OpenSSL\n\nLicensor grants permission to link Covered Software with any version\nof the OpenSSL library from OpenSSL.Org, and distribute linked\ncombinations including the two (assuming such distribution is\notherwise allowed by this agreement). You must obey this License in\nall respects for all code used other than OpenSSL.\n\n12. Waiver; Construction\n\nFailure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of\nthis License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that\nor any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the\nlanguage of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not\napply to this License.\n\n13. Enforceability\n\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nExhibit A. The GNU General Public License Version 2\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\nthereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\nunder the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\nrun, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\nin the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\nno warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling\nthe user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\nannouncement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\nan announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\nto give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\nphysically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\ncopy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\nterms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\nonly for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\nprogram in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\naccord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n[For brevity, we've cut out the GPL's final section on \"How to Apply\nTehse Terms to Your New Program\", but you can find that at\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#SEC4 ]"
