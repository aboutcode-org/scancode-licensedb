This Agreement covers contributions to and downloads from the (&#34;Program&#34;) maintained by Vanderbilt University (&#34;Vanderbilt&#34;). Part A of this Agreement applies to contributions of software and/or data to the Program (including making revisions of or additions to code and/or data already in the Program). Part B of this Agreement applies to downloads of software and/or data from the Program. Part C of this Agreement applies to all transactions with the Program. If you distribute Software (as defined below) downloaded from the Program, all of the paragraphs of Part B of this Agreement must be included with and apply to such Software.

Your contribution of software and/or data to the Program (including prior to the date of the first publication of this Agreement, each a &#34;Contribution&#34;) and/or downloading, copying, modifying, displaying, distributing or use of any software and/or data from the Program (collectively, the &#34;Software&#34;) constitutes acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to such terms and conditions, you have no right to contribute your Contribution, or to download, copy, modify, display, distribute or use the Software.

PART A. CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - License to Vanderbilt with Right to Sublicense (&#34;Contribution Agreement&#34;).

1. As used in this Contribution Agreement, &#34;you&#34; means the individual contributing the Contribution to the Program and the institution or entity which employs or is otherwise affiliated with such individual in connection with such Contribution.

2. This Contribution Agreement applies to all Contributions made to the Program, including without limitation Contributions made prior to the date of first publication of this Agreement. If at any time you make a Contribution to the Program, you represent that (i) you are legally authorized and entitled to make such Contribution and to grant all licenses granted in this Contribution Agreement with respect to such Contribution; (ii) if your Contribution includes any patient data, all such data is de-identified in accordance with U.S. confidentiality and security laws and requirements, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its regulations, and your disclosure of such data for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement is properly authorized and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and (iii) you have preserved in the Contribution all applicable attributions, copyright notices and licenses for any third party software or data included in the Contribution.

3. Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you reserve all right, title and interest in your Contribution.

4. You hereby grant to Vanderbilt, with the right to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, make derivative works of, display and distribute the Contribution as stand-alone software and/or as part of the Program or a larger group of code. If your Contribution is protected by patent, you hereby grant to Vanderbilt, with the right to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under your interest in patent rights covering the Contribution, to make, have made, use, sell and otherwise transfer your Contribution, alone or in combination with any other code.

5. You acknowledge and agree that Vanderbilt shall have no liability arising in connection with claims resulting from your breach of any of the terms of this Agreement.

6. YOU WARRANT THAT TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE YOUR CONTRIBUTION DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY CODE THAT REQURES OR PRESCRIBES AN &#34;OPEN SOURCE LICENSE&#34; FOR DERIVATIVE WORKS (by way of non-limiting example, the GNU General Public License or other so-called &#34;reciprocal&#34; license that requires any derived work to be licensed under the GNU General Public License or other &#34;open source license&#34;).
