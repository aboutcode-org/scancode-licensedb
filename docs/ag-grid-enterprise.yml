  \ form part of any contract between the Licensor and the Licensee.\n2.5 \tThe purchase of\

  \ for a period of 1 year from the relevant Quote Effective Date (or such other period as expressly\
  \ set out in any Quote).\n2.6 \tIn the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the\

  \ only to the extent of any such conflict or inconsistency.\n\n3. Provision of Software Materials\
  \ and Support Services\n3.1 \tThe Licensor shall make the Software Materials available in\
  \ Source Code form at https://github.com/ag-grid on the first Quote Effective Date by provision\
  \ of an activation key and any login details required to access the Software Materials, subject\
  \ to payment of the Fees.\n3.2 \tSubject to clauses 3.3 and 3.4 below, the Licensor grants\
  \ to the Licensee and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable,\
  \ non-sublicensable, royalty-free licence (in the form of a Single Application and/or Multiple\
  \ Applications Developer Licence), commencing on the relevant Quote Effective Date, to permit\
  \ Licensee Developers to use the Software Materials (including taking all the actions permitted\
  \ by clause 3.4 below) in accordance with these Terms, subject to the limit on the number\
  \ of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the relevant Quote. Members within the group\
  \ of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative members as long as the number of\
  \ concurrent Licensee Developers at any time does not exceed the limit set out in the relevant\
  \ Quote. For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying JavaScript code as part\
  \ of the creation or Modification of an Application's user interface, which user interface\
  \ creation or Modification uses the Software shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer.\
  \ For example, if the Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript code with respect\
  \ to the creation or Modification of the user interface of an Application and such creation\
  \ or Modification uses the Software, but only two developers are directly working with the\
  \ Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.\n3.3 \tNotwithstanding\
  \ anything else in these Terms, if the relevant Quote specifies that a Deployment Licence\
  \ Add-On is being granted by the Licensor to the Licensee then:\n(a) \tsubject to this clause\

  \ on the number of permitted Production Environment(s) set out in the relevant Quote;\n(b)\
  \ \tsubject to this clause 3.3 and clause 3.4(a), the Deployment Licence Add-On shall be subject\
  \ to the same applicable licence restrictions as set out in these Terms; and\n(c) \tthe Licensee\
  \ shall ensure (and shall procure that its Affiliates shall ensure) that the terms of any\
  \ sub-licence are in writing and are substantially the same and as restrictive as the terms\
  \ of these Terms (except that the sub-licensee shall not have the right to sub-licence its\
  \ rights).\n3.4 \tThe Licensee and its Affiliates may use the Software Materials to install,\
  \ load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the Software Materials for production,\
  \ test, archival, emergency re-start and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create\
  \ derivative works from the Software Materials in the form of Applications, provided that:\n\
  (a) \tunless the relevant Quote specifies that a Deployment Licence Add-On is being granted\
  \ by the Licensor to the Licensee, any Application created must be used for the Licensee's\
  \ and its Affiliates' internal business purposes only and must not be licensed to third parties;\
  \ and\n(b) \tthe Licensee and its Affiliates shall not permit any end user of any Application\
  \ to use the Software independently of, or by or with any applications other than, the Application\
  \ being used by that end user.\n3.5 \tFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee and its Affiliates\
  \ shall be permitted to create Modifications to the Source Code to the Software for the Licensee's\
  \ (and its Affiliates') use of the Software in accordance with these Terms. In the event that\
  \ the Licensee and/or its Affiliates creates any Modifications to the Source Code to the Software,\
  \ the Licensor shall not be obliged to provide the Support Services in relation to any such\
  \ Modification(s) from the date on which any such Modification(s) take place.\n3.6 \tThe Licensee\
  \ and its Affiliates shall not change or remove the copyright notice from any of the files\
  \ included in the Software Materials.\n3.7 \tThe Licensee and its Affiliates shall not redistribute\
  \ the Software Materials or any Modifications other than as expressly permitted by these Terms.\
  \ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee and its Affiliates shall not redistribute the Software\
  \ Materials or any Modifications:\n(a) \tother than by including the Software or a portion\
  \ of the Software within Application(s); and\n(b) \tas part of any Application that can be\
  \ described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder,\
  \ a user interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by software, application,\
  \ or website developers or designers, or has a similar purpose or functionality (as determined\
  \ by the Licensor).\n3.8 \tSubject to clause 3.5, the Licensor will provide the Support Services\
  \ to the Licensee Developers in accordance with SCHEDULE 1 for a period of 1 year from the\
  \ relevant Quote Effective Date, or for such other period as expressly set out in the relevant\
  \ Quote.\n3.9 \tThe Licensee shall ensure that all its Affiliates comply with all obligations\
  \ of the Affiliates under these Terms, including all restrictions on the licence granted under\
  \ clause 3.2 (notwithstanding the fact that the Affiliates are not party to these Terms).\
  \ The Licensee shall be liable for all acts or omissions of the Affiliates in relation to\
  \ these Terms as if such acts or omissions were the acts or omissions of the Licensee.\n\n\
  4. Trial Licence\n4.1 \tThis clause 4 only applies where a trial licence is being granted.\n\
  4.2 \tNotwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if a trial licence is being granted by\
  \ the Licensor to the Licensee, then:\n(a) \tclauses 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.8 shall not\
  \ apply (unless and until a Licence Quote is entered into between the parties), and the Licensor\
  \ instead hereby grants the Licensee and its Affiliates a revocable, non-exclusive, perpetual,\
  \ non-transferable and non-sublicensable licence to install, load, launch, access, run, execute,\
  \ operate, and archive the Software Materials (as made available on the Effective Date) solely\
  \ for the Licensee's and its Affiliates' internal evaluation and review purposes to determine\
  \ whether to enter into a paid licence of the Software and not for any other purpose;\n(b)\
  \ \tthe Licensee shall be able to access the Software Materials in Source Code form at https://www.github.com/ag-grid\
  \ on the Effective Date;\n(c) \tclauses 13 and 14 shall not apply and these Terms shall commence\
  \ on the Effective Date and shall continue:\n(i) \tfor a period of 60 days, consisting of\
  \ a trial period of 30 days and a further period of 30 days during which the parties can agree\
  \ to enter into a Licence Quote, provided that the entering into of a Licence Quote shall\
  \ cause clauses 13 and 14 to apply; or\n(ii) \tuntil terminated by either party,\n\twhichever\

  \ Licensee can test whether the Software Materials will be suitable for the Licensee's and\
  \ its Affiliates' purposes and that there shall be no acceptance testing process available\
  \ in relation to the Software Materials once a paid licence of the Software has been purchased\
  \ by the Licensee.\n\n5. Charges, invoicing and payment\n5.1 \tThe Fees will be invoiced by\
  \ the Licensor annually in advance upon the relevant Quote Effective Date. Unless otherwise\
  \ agreed in writing between the parties, the Licensee must pay each valid invoice within 30\
  \ days of the date of the invoice.\n5.2 \tUnless otherwise expressly provided in these Terms,\
