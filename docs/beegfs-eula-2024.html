5.) MISCELLANEOUS

This License Agreement in English is the original one. The terms of this
Agreement can only be modified or amended in writing. In case of interpretation
controversies the terms of this Agreement shall prevail over the respective
terms of any other agreements.

This Agreement is construed under the Law of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Therefore, any and all controversies resulting out of this Agreement shall be
resolved under the Law of the Federal Republic of Germany excluding the German
International Private Law Rules. The application of the UN-Convention of the
International Sales of Goods (CISG) is explicitly excluded. Exclusive venue of
jurisdiction for both parties shall be Munich, Germany.

In case that one or several of the terms of this Agreement should be or become
invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the other terms shall remain
unaffected. In such a case, the parties shall replace the invalid or
unenforceable condition by another legally effective provision meeting the
purpose of the abolished provision to the greatest extent. The same applies in
case of a gap of regulation.</code></pre>
