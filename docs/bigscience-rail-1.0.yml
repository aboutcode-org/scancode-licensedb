text: "BigScience RAIL License v1.0\ndated May 19, 2022\n\nThis is a license (the “License”)\
  \ between you (“You”) and the participants of BigScience (“Licensor”). Whereas the Apache\
  \ 2.0 license was applicable to resources used to develop the Model, the licensing conditions\
  \ have been modified for the access and distribution of the Model. This has been done to further\
  \ BigScience’s aims of promoting not just open-access to its artifacts, but also a responsible\
  \ use of these artifacts. Therefore, this Responsible AI License (RAIL)[1] aims at having\
  \ an open and permissive character while striving for responsible use of the Model.\n\n\n\
  \                                                                    Section  I:  PREAMBLE\n\
  \n\nBigScience is a collaborative open innovation project aimed at the responsible development\
  \ and use of large multilingual datasets and Large Language Models (“LLM”), as well as, the\
  \ documentation of best practices and tools stemming from this collaborative effort. Further,\
  \ BigScience participants wish to promote collaboration and sharing of research artifacts\
  \ - including the Model - for the benefit of society, pursuant to this License.\n\n\nThe development\
  \ and use of LLMs, and broadly artificial intelligence (“AI”), does not come without concerns.\
  \ The world has witnessed how just a few companies/institutions are able to develop LLMs,\
  \ and moreover, how Natural Language Processing techniques might, in some instances, become\
  \ a risk for the public in general. Concerns might come in many forms, from racial discrimination\
  \ to the treatment of sensitive information. \n\n\nBigScience believes in the intersection\
  \ between open and responsible AI development, thus, this License aims to strike a balance\
  \ between both in order to enable responsible open-science for large language models and future\
  \ NLP techniques. \nThis License governs the use of the BigScience BLOOM models (and their\
  \ derivatives) and is informed by both the BigScience Ethical Charter and the model cards\
  \ associated with the BigScience BLOOM models. BigScience has set forth its Ethical Charter\
  \ representing the values of  its community. Although the BigScience community does not aim\
  \ to impose its values on potential users of this Model, it is determined to take tangible\
  \ steps towards protecting the community from inappropriate uses of the work being developed\
  \ by BigScience.\nFurthermore, the model cards for the BigScience BLOOM models will inform\
  \ the user about the limitations of the Model, and thus serves as the basis of some of the\
  \ use-based restrictions in this License (See Part II).\n\nNOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor\
  \ agree as follows:\n\n1. Definitions \n\n\n1. \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions\
  \ for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document.\n2. “Data” means a\
  \ collection of texts extracted from the BigScience Corpus used with the Model, including\
  \ to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this\
  \ License. The BigScience Corpus is a collection of existing sources of language data documented\
  \ on the BigScience website.\n3. “Output” means the results of operating a Model as embodied\
  \ in informational content resulting therefrom.\n4. “Model” means any accompanying machine-learning\
  \ based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including\
  \ optimizer states), corresponding to the BigScience BLOOM model architecture as embodied\
  \ in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part, on\
  \ the Data using the Complementary Material. \n5. “Derivatives of the Model” means all modifications\
  \ to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized\
  \ by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model,\
  \ to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model,\
  \ including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate\
  \ data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for\
  \ training the other model.\n6. “Complementary Material” shall mean the accompanying source\
  \ code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to\
  \ prepare data for training or evaluation. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials,\
  \ examples etc.\n7. “Distribution” means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other\
  \ sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the\
  \ Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based\
  \ or web access. \n8. “Licensor” means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright\
  \ owner that is granting the License, including the persons or entities that may have rights\
  \ in the Model and/or distributing the Model.\n9. \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual\
  \ or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the\
  \ Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an\
  \ end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator.\n10. “Third Parties” means individuals or\
  \ legal entities that are not under common control with Licensor or You.\n11. \"Contribution\"\
  \ shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Model and any modifications\
  \ or additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted\
  \ to Licensor for inclusion in the Model by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal\
  \ Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,\
  \ “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor\
  \ or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing\
  \ lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on\
  \ behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Model, but excluding\
  \ communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright\
  \ owner as \"Not a Contribution.\" \n12. \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual\
  \ or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently\
  \ incorporated within the Model.\n\n\n                                              Section\
  \ II:   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\nBoth copyright and patent grants apply to the Model,\
  \ Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model\
  \ are subject to additional terms as described in Section III.\n2. Grant of Copyright License.\
  \ Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You\
  \ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\
  \ to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
  \ Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model.\n3. Grant of Patent License.\
  \ Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You\
  \ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated\
  \ in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,\
  \ and otherwise transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where such license applies\
  \ only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed\
  \ by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Model\
  \ to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against\
  \ any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model\
  \ and/or Complementary Material or a Contribution incorporated within the Model and/or Complementary\
  \ Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
  \ granted to You under this License for the Model and/or Work shall terminate as of the date\
  \ such litigation is filed.\n\n\nSection III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION\n\
  \n\n4. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote access purposes\
  \ (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the Model or Derivatives\
  \ of the Model thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, provided that You meet\
  \ the following conditions:\n1. Use-based restrictions as referenced in paragraph 5 MUST be\
  \ included as an enforceable provision by You in any type of legal agreement (e.g. a license)\
  \ governing the use and/or distribution of the Model or Derivatives of the Model, and You\
  \ shall give notice to subsequent users You Distribute to, that the Model or Derivatives of\
  \ the Model are subject to paragraph 5. This provision does not apply to the use of Complementary\
  \ Material.\n2. You must give any Third Party recipients of the Model or Derivatives of the\
  \ Model a copy of this License; \n3. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent\
  \ notices stating that You changed the files; \n4. You must retain all copyright, patent,\
  \ trademark, and attribution notices excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part\

  \ modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions - respecting\
  \ paragraph 4.a. - for use, reproduction, or Distribution of Your modifications, or for any\
  \ such Derivatives of the Model as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and Distribution\
  \ of the Model otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n5. Use-based\
  \ restrictions. The restrictions set forth in Attachment A are considered Use-based restrictions.\
  \ Therefore You cannot use the Model and the Derivatives of the Model for the specified restricted\
  \ uses. You may use the Model subject to this License, including only for lawful purposes\
  \ and in accordance with the License. Use may include creating any content with, finetuning,\
  \ updating, running, training, evaluating and/or reparametrizing the Model. You shall require\

  \ any provision as stated in the License. \n\n\nSection IV: OTHER PROVISIONS\n7. Updates and\
  \ Runtime Restrictions. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Licensor reserves the right\
  \ to restrict (remotely or otherwise) usage of the Model in violation of this License, update\
  \ the Model through electronic means, or modify the Output of the Model based on updates.\
  \ You shall undertake reasonable efforts to use the latest version of the Model.\n8. Trademarks\
  \ and related. Nothing in this License permits You to make use of Licensors’ trademarks, trade\
  \ names, logos or to otherwise suggest endorsement or misrepresent the relationship between\
  \ the parties; and any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Licensors.\n\
  9. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\
  \ provides the Model and the Complementary Material (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)\
  \ on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,\
  \ including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\
  \ MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining\
  \ the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Model, Derivatives of the Model, and\
  \ the Complementary Material and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions\
  \ under this License.\n10. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
  \ whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable\
  \ law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
  \ be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential\
  \ damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability\
  \ to use the Model and the Complementary Material (including but not limited to damages for\
  \ loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial\
  \ damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such\
