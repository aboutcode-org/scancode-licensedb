text: "AWS Intellectual Property License\nLast Updated: September 17, 2021\n\nThis Intellectual\
  \ Property License (“License”) governs your use of AWS Content and the Services. Capitalized\
  \ terms used but not defined in this License are defined in the AWS Customer Agreement or\
  \ other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”).\n\n1. AWS\
  \ Licensor\nIf the geographic location associated with your AWS account is any country within\
  \ Europe, the Middle East, or Africa (“ EMEA ”), then Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (“ AWS\
  \ Europe ”) grants this License.  If the geographic location associated with your AWS account\
  \ is any country outside of EMEA, then Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“ AWS, Inc .”) grants this\
  \ License.  “AWS Europe” and “AWS, Inc.” are individually referred to herein as an “ AWS Licensor\
  \ ”.  \n\n2. No Agency\n\nThis License forms a separate agreement between you and the AWS\
  \ Licensor without any further action required by the parties.  AWS Licensor grants this License\
  \ in its own capacity and no other party is acting as agent of AWS Licensor or has capacity\
  \ to bind AWS Licensor.\n\n3. License\n\nAWS Licensor or its licensors own all right, title,\
  \ and interest in and to the Services, AWS Content, and all related technology and intellectual\
  \ property rights.  Subject to the terms of this License and the Agreement, AWS Licensor grants\
  \ you a limited, royalty-free, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable\
  \ license to copy and use the AWS Content solely in connection with your permitted use of\
  \ the Services during the Term. Solely to the extent that applicable law requires the exercise\
  \ of intellectual property rights owned by AWS Licensor or its licensors for you to access\
  \ or use any Service, AWS Licensor grants you a limited, royalty-free, revocable, non-exclusive,\
  \ non-sublicensable and non-transferrable license to exercise such intellectual property rights\
  \ during the Term and subject to the terms of this License and the Agreement.  No other entity\
  \ is entitled to or purports to grant or procure the grant of this License.  Except as expressly\
  \ provided in this Section 3, you obtain no other rights under the Agreement or this License\
  \ from AWS Licensor, its affiliates or suppliers to the Services and AWS Content, including\
  \ any related intellectual property rights.  Some AWS Content and Third-Party Content may\
  \ be provided to you under a separate license, such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, or\
  \ other open source license.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any separate\
  \ license, the separate license will prevail with respect to the AWS Content or Third-Party\
  \ Content that is the subject of such separate license.\n\n4. License Restrictions\n\nNeither\
  \ you nor any End User will use the Services or AWS Content in any manner or for any purpose\
  \ other than as expressly permitted by this License and the Agreement.  Neither you nor any\
  \ End User will, or will attempt to (a) modify, distribute, alter, tamper with, repair, or\
  \ otherwise create derivative works of any Content included in the Services or AWS Content\
  \ (except to the extent such Content is provided to you under a separate license that expressly\
  \ permits the creation of derivative works), or (b) sublicense the Services or AWS Content.\
  \  These license restrictions will continue to apply following the termination of this License."
