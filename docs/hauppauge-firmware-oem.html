LICENSEES: Please note:

* If you are an End-User, only the END-USER FIRMWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
  applies.

* If you are an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Independent
  Hardware Vendor (IHV), or Independent Firmware Vendor (ISV), the
  OEM/IHV/ISV FIRMWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT applies (this license), as
  well as the END-USER FIRMWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT.

LICENSE. This Firmware is licensed for use only in conjunction with

the terms of this Agreement, Hauppauge grants to you a nonexclusive,
nontransferable, worldwide, fully paid-up license under Hauppauge&#39;s
copyrights to: (i) copy the Firmware internally for your own
development and maintenance purposes; (ii) copy and distribute the
Firmware to your end-users, but only under a license agreement with
terms at least as restrictive as those contained in Hauppauge&#39;s
END-USER FIRMWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT; and (iii) modify, copy and
distribute the end-user documentation which may accompany the
Firmware, but only in association with the Firmware.

If you are not the final manufacturer or vendor of a computer system
or firmware program incorporating the Firmware, then you may transfer
a copy of the Firmware, including any related documentation (modified
or unmodified) to your recipient for use in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, provided such recipient agrees to be fully bound by
the terms hereof. You shall not otherwise assign, sublicense, lease,
or in any other way transfer or disclose Firmware to any third
party. You may not, nor may you assist any other person or entity to

reverse engineer, or disassemble any portion of the Firmware or
otherwise attempt to derive source code from any object code modules
of the Firmware or any internal data files generated by the
Firmware. Your rights to redistribute the Firmware shall be contingent
upon your installation of this Agreement in its entirety in the same
directory as the Firmware.

CONTRACTORS. For the purpose of this Agreement, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary hereunder, solely with respect to the
requirements for compliance with the terms hereunder, any contractors
or consultants that You use to perform the work or otherwise assist
You in the development or products using this Firmware shall be deemed
