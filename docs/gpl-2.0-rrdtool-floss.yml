  \nFLOSS License Exception \n=======================\n(Adapted from http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html\
  \ )\n\nI want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (\"FLOSS\")\napplications to be\
  \ able to use specified GPL-licensed RRDtool\nlibraries (the \"Program\") despite the fact\
  \ that not all FLOSS licenses are\ncompatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License\
  \ (the \"GPL\").\n\nAs a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the\
  \ GPL:\n\nYou are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from\nthe Program\
  \ and one or more works (each, a \"FLOSS Work\") licensed under one\nor more of the licenses\
  \ listed below, as long as:\n\n1. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the\
  \ Derivative\nWork, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are\nnot\
  \ derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered\nindependent and separate\
  \ works in themselves,\n\n2. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not\
  \ derived\nfrom the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and\nseparate\
  \ works in themselves,\n\n1. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed\n\
  below, and\n\n2. the object code or executable form of those sections are\naccompanied by\
  \ the complete corresponding machine-readable source\ncode for those sections on the same\
  \ medium and under the same FLOSS\nlicense as the corresponding object code or executable\
  \ forms of\nthose sections, and\n\n3. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with\
  \ a Derivative\nWork on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with\n\
  the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves which\
  \ are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative\nWork or a FLOSS Work.\n\nIf the\
  \ above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied,\nmodified, distributed\
  \ or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL.\n\nFLOSS License List\n==================\n\
