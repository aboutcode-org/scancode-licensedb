  "text": "3DFX GLIDE Source Code General Public License\n\n1. PREAMBLE\n\nThis license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application\nprogram interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar\nto some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open\nstandards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these\nlicenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software,\nany derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing\nthe original program or a portion of it) must be available for general\nuse, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that\nthe source code for such derivative works must likewise be made\navailable. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be\nsubject to the same General Public License terms as the original work.\n\nThis 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the\nstandard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire\nderivative work to be made available under the terms of this license\nnor is the recipient required to make available the source code for\nthe entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the\nidentifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the\nlicensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n\n2. DEFINITIONS\n\n2.1 This License applies to any program (or other \"work\") which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General\nPublic License.\n\n2.2 The term \"Program\" as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX's\nGLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work.\n\n2.3 \"Derivative Work\" means, for the purpose of the License, that\nportion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable\nportion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or\nwith modifications and/or translated into another language, and that\nperforms 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other\nportions of a work.\n\n2.4 \"Modifications of the Program\" means any work, which includes a\nDerivative Work, and includes the whole of such work.\n\n2.5 \"License\" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.\n\n2.6 The \"Source Code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, any\nassociated interface definition files, and the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the executable work.\n\n2.7 \"3dfx\" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc.\n\n\n3. LICENSED ACTIVITIES\n\n3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the\nProgram's Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the\nprovision of section 3.3 and provided also that:\n\n(a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\nan appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc. 1999), a notice\nthat recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Program can\nonly do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as\nset forth in section 5;\n\n(b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and\nto the absence of any warranty; and\n\n(c) do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior\nwritten permission of 3dfx, and\n\n(d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy\nof this License.\n\n\n3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS - You may modify your\ncopy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications subject to the provisions of section 3.3\nand provided that you also meet all of the following conditions:\n\n(a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\nof a Derivative Work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that\nrecipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Derivative Work\ncan only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty\nas set forth in section 5;\n\n(b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and\nto the absence of any warranty; and\n\n(c) give all recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this\nLicense along with the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily\nreceive a copy of this License.\n\n(d) You must cause the modified files of the Derivative Work\nto carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\ndate of any change.\n\n(e) You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute or\npublish to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the\nterms of this License.\n\n(f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the\nprior written permission of 3dfx.\n\n(g) If the Derivative Work normally reads commands\ninteractively when run, you must cause it, when started running for\nsuch interactive use, to print or display an announcement as follows:\n\n\"COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS\nSOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

It is not\nthe intent of this License to claim rights or contest your rights to\nwork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of Derivative Works.\n\n\n3.3 DISTRIBUTION\n\n(a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which are\ndistributed must include in the file headers the following language\nverbatim:\n\n\"THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED\nONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

(This alternative\nis allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\nthe program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\naccord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.)\n\n(c) The source code distributed need not include anything\nthat is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with\nthe major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\nsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable code.\n\n(d) If distribution of executable code or object code is made\nby offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering\nequivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts\nas distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n(e) Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative\nWork, the recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and\nsuccessor licensors to copy, distribute or modify the Program and\nDerivative Works subject to the terms and conditions of the License.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein.

Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nProgram or Derivative Works and doing so without acceptance of this\nLicense is in violation of the U.S. and international copyright laws.\n\n4.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works\nis restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under\nthis License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in\nor among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n4.3 This License is to be construed according to the laws of the\nState of California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the\nState of California in the event it is necessary to enforce the\nprovisions of this License.\n\n\n5.
