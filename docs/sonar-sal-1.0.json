A product or service may compete regardless\nof how it is designed or deployed.

Contributions do not include changes or\nadditions to the Program that are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form,\nthat is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial\nrevisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a\nwhole, an original work of authorship.\n\n\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any\nmanner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results\nfrom an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the\nProgram, including, for purposes of clarity, any new file in Source Code form\nthat contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include\nworks that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or\nfiles of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or\nsubclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.\n\n\"Non-competitive Purpose\" means any purpose except for (a) providing to others\nany product or service that includes or offers the same or substantially similar\nfunctionality as SonarQube, (b) Competing with SonarQube, and/or (c) employing,\nusing, or engaging artificial intelligence technology that is not part of the\nProgram to ingest, interpret, analyze, train on, or interact with the data\nprovided by the Program, or to engage with the Program in any manner.\n\n\"Notices\" means any legal statements or attributions included with the Program,\nincluding, without limitation, statements concerning copyright, patent,\ntrademark, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding Contributors.\n\n\"SonarQube\" means an open-source or commercial edition of software offered by\nSonarSource that is branded \"SonarQube\".\n\n\"SonarSource\" means SonarSource SA, a Swiss company registered in Switzerland\nunder UID No. CHE-114.587.664.\n\n\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications,\nincluding but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and\nconfiguration files.\n\n2.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of\nthe Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by\nthe Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\ncovered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\ncombinations that include the Contribution.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to\nits Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\nContributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights of any other entity.
