Common Cure Rights Commitment
Version 1.0
 
Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim
(other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered
License, we commit to extend to the person or entity ('you') accused
of violating the Covered License the following provisions regarding
cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the
term 'this License' refers to the specific Covered License being
enforced.

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
    and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
    copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
    reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you
    have received notice of violation of this License (for any work)
    from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
    days after your receipt of the notice.

We intend this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and
enforceable against us and assignees of or successors to our
copyrights.
