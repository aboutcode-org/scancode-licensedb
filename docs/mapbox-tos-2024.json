  "text": "Terms of Service\n\nLast updated March 31, 2024\n\nThese terms and conditions govern your use of Mapbox\u2019s services, unless you have an active executed order.\n\nWelcome to the future of mapping! We're glad you're here.\n\nThis website, www.mapbox.com (the \"site\"), is owned and operated by Mapbox, Inc. and our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (\"Mapbox\", \"we\" or \u201cus\u201d). By using the site, services and our proprietary software and related data we make available to you via the site or a third-party marketplace (\u201cMarketplace\u201d), or map content we make available to you through the services (all the foregoing collectively, \"Services\"), you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the \"Terms\"). Please read them carefully. If you don\u2019t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.\n\nIf you reside in Japan or if your principal place of business is in Japan, your access and use of Services is governed by the Japan Terms of Service.  \n\nSigning up\n\n    In order to use most Services, you must register for or authenticate into a Mapbox account. To use our Services through a Marketplace, you may additionally or alternatively be required to register for or authenticate into a separate account for that Marketplace. When you use our application program interfaces (APIs), including our SDK Registry/Downloads API, each request to an API must include one of your account's unique API keys.\n    Please carefully guard the security of your account and monitor use of your API keys. You are responsible for all use of the Services under your account, whether or not authorized, including any use of your API keys. At our discretion, we may make limited exceptions to this policy for unauthorized use of your account if you notify us of the problem promptly.\n    You must be 18 years or older to use the Services. By registering as a user or providing personal information on the site, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\n    If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your company or another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case \"you\" will mean the entity you represent.\n    If you are a United States government user or otherwise accessing or using any Mapbox service in a U.S. government capacity, these Terms are amended as set out in our U.S. Government Terms of Service.\n\nOur services\n\n    Subject to these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license and right to (i) incorporate the Services in Licensed Applications (as defined in the Product Terms), and  (ii) make the Services as incorporated in Licensed Applications available to End Users (as defined in the Product Terms).\u200d  Your right in (i) above includes the right to access and use the Services in a Licensed Application for non-production use (i.e., used solely for your internal development, evaluation, testing and demonstration and not in the course of any business operation, process or analysis) as long as your Licensed Application is not related to vehicle usage.\u200d  Your right in (ii) above is conditional upon purchasing an additional license for a Licensed Application when required under these Terms.\n    If your Licensed Application is related to business intelligence or analytics, sales performance management, cloud database management systems, or real estate, you must purchase a separate commercial license under an active order before accessing or using Services in your Licensed Application for any production use.\n    If your Licensed Application is related to vehicle usage, you must purchase a separate development license for non-production use and a separate commercial license for production use under an active order before accessing or using Services in your application.  For purposes of these Terms, vehicles include ground, aerial, manned and unmanned vehicles and vehicle usage includes (i) applications primarily intended for use within vehicles, or (ii) use in any vehicle system or component thereof (whether installed in a vehicle during manufacture or thereafter).\n    Contact us if you are looking to use enterprise-only products and services or obtain additional volume-based discounts. \n    We may choose to make available to you products and services that are in beta, being provided for internal evaluation or trial, or otherwise not generally available (\u201cEvaluation Products\u201d). By accessing such Evaluation Products, you agree to only use them for internal evaluation or testing purposes. Upon our written request, you shall immediately cease all use, and destroy all copies, of Evaluation Products, and you shall provide us with written certification of such deletion.\n\nEnd Users and Notification\n\n    You may not allow your End Users or other third parties to use the Services in any way that would be a violation of these Terms if done by you, and you agree to take reasonable efforts to prevent such use. You agree to promptly notify Mapbox in writing if you become aware of any misappropriation or unauthorized use of the Services.\n\nService Terms & Policies\n\n    You will comply with these Terms, our Product Terms, Data Processing Addendum (for data processed by Mapbox as a processor) and Privacy Policy (for data otherwise processed by Mapbox), which govern access and/or use of the Services.\n    In addition to the requirements above, you agree to adhere to the policies posted on this site in conjunction with the Services, including accompanying documentation.\n    All terms and policies referred to above are incorporated by reference into these Terms.\n\nCharges and Payment\n\n    You agree to pay all fees owed for your use of the Services, as calculated by our records and based on (i) our publicly available pricing, currently located at www.mapbox.com/pricing, if you use the Services directly through our site or (ii) the pricing included in the listing information accompanying the Services offered via a Marketplace if you transact for use of the Services through such Marketplace. All charges are non-refundable unless expressly prohibited by applicable law. We or a third party acting on our behalf or pursuant to our instructions (\u201cPayment Partner\u201d) may invoice and charge you on a recurring basis for any amounts that you owe us, some of which may require advance payments.\n    You acknowledge and agree that failure to use the current version of Mapbox SDKs may result in potentially different (and higher) fees being charged to you, and agree to pay any such fees as calculated by us.\n    Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by us in collecting such delinquent amounts.\n    We are not responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Mapbox or a Payment Partner. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card or your bank.\n    Our listed fees, whether on this site or accompanying our offering of the Services via a Marketplace, do not include taxes, and you agree to pay all sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property or other tax (including any interest and penalties) with respect to the transactions and payments under these Terms, other than taxes based on our net income, employees or real property. You agree to work with us and our Payment Partners to help us obtain any necessary withholding or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments made by you to us under these Terms, whether directly or through a Payment Partner, will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us after such deduction or withholding, will be equal to the full amount that we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. The payment of any taxes, charges or fees required to be deducted or withheld from payments due to us, and the filing of any information or tax returns with respect thereto, shall be your responsibility. Upon your reasonable request, we will provide you with any existing tax forms in our possession that would reduce or eliminate the amount of any such withholding or deduction for taxes.\n\nContent and Data\nYour content\n\n    You retain ownership of all content that you contribute to the Services via Mapbox Studio, Mapbox Studio Classic, the Dataset API, the Tileset API, and the Uploads API, excluding any content that you receive from Mapbox (\"Your Content\").\n    Limited to the purposes of hosting Your Content so that we can provide the Services to you and, if you choose to make Your Content publicly available, making Your Content available for download and use by other users of the Services via the Mapbox Gallery, you hereby grant Mapbox a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable and sublicensable right and license to (and to engage service providers to) host, install, use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify, create derivative works, and store Your Content. This right and license enables Mapbox to host and mirror your content on its distributed platform. You warrant, represent, and agree that you have the right to grant Mapbox these rights.\n    On termination of your account, Mapbox will make reasonable efforts to promptly remove from the site and cease use of Your Content; however, you recognize and agree that caching of or references to the content may not be immediately removed.\u200d\n\nOur content and third-party content\n\n    Other than Your Content, all content displayed on the site or accessible through the Services, including text, images, maps, software or source code, are the property of Mapbox and/or third parties and are protected by United States and international intellectual property laws. Logos and product names appearing on or in connection with the Services are proprietary to Mapbox or our licensors. You may not remove any proprietary notices or product identification labels from the Services.\n    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, you agree to, and nothing shall restrict or limit, anonymization & creation by Mapbox of de-identified aggregated data obtained through or derived from the Services as permitted by applicable law.\n\nFeedback\n\n    You agree that we may freely exploit and make available any and all feedback, suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, recommendations or other information you provide to us relating to the Services.\n\nPublicity\n\n    We're proud to have you as a customer. During the term of this agreement, you hereby grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable and sublicensable license to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos for the purpose of identifying you as a Mapbox customer to promote and market our services. But if you prefer we not use your logo or name in a particular way, just let us know, and we will respect that.\n\nAccount cancellation or suspension\n\n    We don't want you to leave, but you may cancel at any time. However, we do not give pro-rated refunds if you cancel during the middle of a billing cycle.\n    If you breach any of these Terms, the limited license granted to you hereunder automatically terminates without notice to you and we may immediately without notice cancel or suspend your account. In addition, Mapbox may cancel or suspend your account for any reason by providing you 30 days' advance notice.\n    Upon any termination of the limited license, you agree to immediately destroy any materials or other data or content provided by, downloaded from, or otherwise accessed through the Services.\n    Upon cancellation or suspension, your right to use the Services will stop immediately. You may not have access to data that you stored on the site after we cancel or suspend your account. You are responsible for backing up data that you use with the Services. If we cancel your account in its entirety without cause, we will refund to you on a pro-rata basis the amount of your payment corresponding to the portion of your service remaining right before we cancelled your account.\n\nChanges to services or terms\n\n    We may modify these Terms and other terms related to your use of the Services (like our Privacy Policy) from time to time, by posting the changed terms on the site. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the site unless they specify a later date. Changes will not apply retroactively. Please check these Terms periodically for changes - your continued use of the Services after new terms become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of the new terms.\n    We may change the features and functions of the Services, including APIs. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to the Services are compatible with our then-current APIs. We attempt to avoid changes to our APIs that are not backwards compatible, but such changes may occasionally be required. If that happens, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you prior to deploying the changes.\n\nIndemnification\n\n    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Mapbox and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, partners, and employees from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of:\n        Your use of the Services;\n        Your violation of these Terms or any terms associated with a Marketplace through which you acquire or use the Services;\n        Your End Users\u2019 use of the Services in or through an application or service you provide;\n        Content you or your End Users submit, post to, extracts from, or transmit through the Services.\n\nDisclaimers\n\n    \u201cAs is,\" \"as available\" and \"with all faults.\" YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

Mapbox reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.\n    If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
