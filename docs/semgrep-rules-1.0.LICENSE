Limitations

You may use the rules only for your own internal business purposes. This license does not allow you to distribute the rules, or to make them available to others as a service.

You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the rules. If you copy any of the rules, you must also include the notices of the licensor in that copy. Any use of the licensorâ€™s trademarks is subject to applicable law.

The licensor grants you a license, under any patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and have imported the rules, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions in this license. This license does not cover any patent claims that you cause to be infringed by modifications or additions to the rules. If you or your company make any written claim that the rules or any Semgrep product or service infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the rules granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

No Liability

As far as the law allows, the rules come as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the rules, under any kind of legal claim.
