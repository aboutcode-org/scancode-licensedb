We want to allow in part what\nsection 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special\ncase of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a\nJava Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the\nfuture as another exception but one is not currently available.\n\nhttp://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you\npermission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with\nRXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,\nregardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy\nand distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,\nprovided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete\ncopy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the\ncombined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License plus this exception.  An independent module is a\nmodule which is not derived from or based on RXTX.\n\nNote that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated\nto grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is\ntheir choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License\ngives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this\nexception also makes it possible to release a modified version which\ncarries forward this exception."
