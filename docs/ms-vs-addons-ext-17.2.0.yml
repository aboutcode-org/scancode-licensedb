text: "MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\n\nMICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO ADD-ONs and EXTENSIONS  \n\
  \nThese license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you\
  \ live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named above. The terms\
  \ also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those\
  \ have different terms.\n\nIF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.\n\
  \n1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. \n\n\tYou may install and use any number of copies of the\
  \ software to use solely with\n\t\t* Visual Studio Community \n\t\t* Visual Studio Professional\
  \  \n\t\t* Visual Studio Enterprise \n\t\t* Visual Studio Code \n\n2. TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.\n\
  \ta. Microsoft Platforms.  The software may include components from Microsoft Windows, Microsoft\
  \ Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office, or Microsoft\
  \ SharePoint. These components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support\
  \ policies, as described in the Microsoft Licenses folder accompanying the software, except\
  \ that, if license terms for those components are also included in the associated installation\
  \ directory, those license terms control.\n\tb. Third Party Components. The software may include\
  \ third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may\
  \ be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software. \n\tc. Package\
  \ Managers. The software includes package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to\
  \ download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use with your applications.\
  \ Those packages are under their own licenses, and not these license terms. Microsoft does\
  \ not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.\n\
  \n3. DATA.  \n\ta. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your\
  \ use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide\
  \ services and improve our products and services.  You may opt-out of many of these scenarios,\
  \ but not all, as described in the software documentation.  There are also some features in\
  \ the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications.\
  \ If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate\
  \ notices to users of your applications and you should provide a copy of Microsoft's privacy\
  \ statement to your users. The Microsoft privacy statement is located here https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704.\
  \ You can learn more about data collection and use from the software documentation and our\
  \ privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.\n\
  \tb. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of\
  \ personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European\
  \ Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers\
  \ effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.\n\n4. SCOPE OF LICENSE.\
  \ The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights to use\
  \ the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more\
  \ rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in\
  \ these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the\
  \ software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not\n\t* work\
  \ around any technical limitations in the software;\n\t* reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble\
  \ the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software except, and\
  \ only to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing the use of certain\
  \ open source components that may be included in the software;\n\t* remove, minimize, block\
  \ or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software; \n\t* use the software\
  \ in any way that is against the law; \n\t* share, publish, rent, or lease the software; or\
  \ \n\t* provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of your applications\
  \ for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.\n\n5.\
  \ EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and\
  \ regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end\
  \ users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.\
  \ \n\n6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is \"as is\", we may not provide support\
  \ services for it.\n\n7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements,\
  \ updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement\
  \ for the software and support services.\n\n8. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software\
  \ in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach\
  \ of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If\
  \ you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.\n\n9. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL\
  \ VARIATIONS. These license terms describe certain legal rights. You may have other rights,\
  \ including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights\
  \ with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not\
  \ change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.\
  \ For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country\
  \ law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\n\ta. Australia. You have statutory\
  \ guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to\
  \ affect those rights.\n\tb. Canada. You may stop receiving updates on your device by turning\
  \ off Internet access. If and when you re-connect to the Internet, the software will resume\
  \ checking for and installing updates.\n\tc. Germany and Austria.\n\t\t(i)\tWarranty. The\
  \ properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials\
  \ that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation\
  \ to the licensed software.\n\t\t(ii)\tLimitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct,\
  \ gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in the case of\
  \ death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.\n\
  \n\tSubject to the preceding sentence (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence\
  \ if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which\
  \ facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the\
  \ purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in\
  \ (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will\
  \ not be liable for slight negligence.\n\n10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED\
  \ \"AS-IS\".  YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES\
  \ OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED\
  \ WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n\
  11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS\
  \ ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL,\
  \ LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\n\nThis limitation applies to (a)\
  \ anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet\
  \ sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,\
  \ guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted\
  \ by applicable law.\nIt also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the\
  \ possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because\
  \ your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other\
  \ damages."
