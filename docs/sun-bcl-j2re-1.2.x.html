2.  RESTRICTIONS Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to
Software and all associated intellectual property rights is retained
by Sun and/or its licensors.  Except as specifically authorized in any
Supplemental License Terms, you may not make copies of Software, other
than a single copy of Software for archival purposes.  Unless
enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify,
decompile, reverse engineer Software.  Software is not designed or
licensed for use in on-line control of aircraft, air traffic, aircraft

you will not use Software for these purposes.  You may not publish or
provide the results of any benchmark or comparison tests run on
Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Sun.
No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo
or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

3. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety
(90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be
free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except
for the foregoing, Software is provided &#34;AS IS&#34;.  Your exclusive
remedy and Sun&#39;s entire liability under this limited warranty will be
at Sun&#39;s option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for

4.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, 
ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT 
TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, 
IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL 
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO 
USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun&#39;s liability to you, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount
paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose.

6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You
may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of
Software.  This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
Upon Termination, you must destroy all copies of Software.

governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No
choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

10.  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, This Agreement will remain in effect with the provision
omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in
which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you
and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or
additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other
