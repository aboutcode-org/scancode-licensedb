text: "SIESTA LICENCE for COMPUTER CENTRES\n\nMotivation and Preamble\n\nThe SIESTA program\
  \ has been devised for its general use in research\nwithin the academic community. Some conditions\
  \ have been defined for\nthe use, distribution, and modification of SIESTA, which the authors\n\
  consider fair and within the common fair practices in the academic\ncommunity.\n\n\n1. Definitions\n\
  \n\"The Authors\" are:\n\n    * Emilio Artacho, University of Cambridge, and IkerBasque and\n\
  \    CIC-Nanogune, San Sebastián * José María Cela,\n    Barcelona Supercomputing Center *\
  \ Julian Gale, Curtin University\n    of Technology, Perth * Alberto García, ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona\
  \ *\n    Javier Junquera, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander * Pablo\n    Ordejón, CIN2-CSIC,\
  \ Barcelona * Daniel Sánchez-Portal, Centro\n    de Física de Materiales, CSIC-UPV/EHU, San\
  \ Sebastián * \n    José M. Soler, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid\n\nAlthough we, the Authors,\
  \ acknowledge that a limited number of\nauxiliary subroutines were written by (or are based\
  \ on previous\nsubroutines written by) other authors consider that the implementation\nof\
  \ all the basic algorithms of the SIESTA program is ours.\n\nThe Siesta team (\"the Developers\"\
  ) are the Authors and:\n\n    * Richard M. Martin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\
  \n\"The Copyright-Holder\" is the set of Authors.\n\nThe valid distributors of the Siesta\
  \ package (\"The Distributors\") are\nthe Developers as specified above.\n\n\"The SIESTA package\"\
  \ is the suite of software, including the SIESTA\ncode itself, but also all other software,\
  \ documentation, scripts, and\nancillary support material distributed as a single entity.\
  \ This\nLicence covers the entirety of said data.\n\nThe Licensee is the person (never an\
  \ institution) to whom the SIESTA\npackage is distributed (under the terms of this Licence)\
  \ by the\nDistributors; they are bound by this agreement.\n\n\n\n2. NO WARRANTY \n\nThere\
  \ is no warranty for any part of the SIESTA package. The SIESTA\npackage is provided by the\
  \ Distributors \"as-is\" without warranty of\nany kind, either express or implied, including\
  \ but not limited to the\nimplied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular\n\
  purpose. In no event shall the Distributors be liable for any direct,\nindirect, incidental,\
  \ special, exemplary, or consequential damages\n(including, but not limited to, procurement\
  \ of substitute goods or\nservices; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption)\n\
  however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract,\nstrict liability, or\
  \ tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising\nin any way out of the use of this software,\
  \ even if advised of the\npossibility of such damage. The entire risk as to the quality or\n\
  performance of the program, or any action the Licensee may take based\non the output of any\
  \ part of the SIESTA package, is with the Licensee.\n\n\n3. Limitation of Usage \n\nThe Licensee\
  \ is hereby provided with a non-exclusive, royalty-free\nright to install the SIESTA package\
  \ in any (or several) of the\ncomputers of the Licensee’s Centre, and manipulate it in order\
  \ to\ncompile the SIESTA program and the auxiliary programs distributed in\nthe package, and\
  \ to make the binary executable files (of SIESTA and\nauxiliary codes) accessible to any independently\
  \ licensed SIESTA user\nthat has access to the Licensee computers. The Licensee is bound by\n\
  this agreement to grant access to the (source or executable) files\nonly to people holding\
  \ a valid Licence to use SIESTA, and prevent\naccess to any other party. \n\nThis Licence\
  \ does not grant the Licensee the right to use, develop or\ndistribute either the SIESTA package\
  \ or any of its components. For\nsuch purposes, a separate SIESTA user licence has to be issued\
  \ to a\nmember or members of the Licensee Centre (person, not the\ninstitution), if applicable.\n\
  \nThe Licensee is hereby also requested to cite the following papers in\nany document issued\
  \ by the Centre that refers to the SIESTA package:\n\n    1. “Self-consistent order-N density-functional\
  \ calculations for\n    very large systems”, P. Ordejón, E. Artacho and J. M. Soler,\n   \
  \ Phys. Rev. B (Rapid Comm.) 53, R10441-10443 (1996).\n\n    2. “The SIESTA method for ab\
  \ initio order-N materials simulation”\n    J. M. Soler, E. Artacho,J. D. Gale, A. García,\
  \ J. Junquera,\n    P. Ordejón, and D. Sánchez-Portal, J. Phys.: Condens. Matt. 14,\n    2745-2779\
  \ (2002).\n\nOther papers relevant to the SIESTA package and method can also be\ncited as\
  \ best scientific practice dictates. Licensees are recommended\nto send reference to the Developers\
  \ of any publication containing\nresults wholly or partially derived from the results of use\
  \ of the\nSIESTA package.\n\n4. Support \n\nThe present Licence does not imply support services\
  \ of any kind to the\nLicensee by the Distributors, including, but not limited to,\ninstallation,\
  \ compilation and use of the software in the package.\n\n5. All Other Rights \n\nAll other\
  \ rights not explicitly mentioned in this document are\nreserved. In particular, the Authors\
  \ reserve all rights to resolve any\nand all conflicts arising in the development and distribution\
  \ policies\nof the SIESTA package."
