This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between you (“Licensee”) and LG Management Development 
Institute Co., Ltd. (“Licensor”), governing the use of the EXAONE AI Model (“Model”). By downloading, 
installing, copying, or using the Model, you agree to comply with and be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not agree to all the terms, you must not download, install, copy, or use the Model. This Agreement 
constitutes a binding legal agreement between the Licensee and Licensor.

1. Definitions
    1.1 Model: The artificial intelligence model provided by Licensor, which includes any software, 
    algorithms, machine learning models, or related components supplied by Licensor. This definition extends 
    to encompass all updates, enhancements, improvements, bug fixes, patches, or other modifications that may 
    be provided by Licensor from time to time, whether automatically or manually implemented.
    1.2 Derivatives: Any modifications, alterations, enhancements, improvements, adaptations, or derivative 
    works of the Model created by Licensee or any third party. This includes changes made to the Model&#39;s 
    architecture, parameters, data processing methods, or any other aspect of the Model that results in a 
    modification of its functionality or output.
    1.3 Output: Any data, results, content, predictions, analyses, insights, or other materials generated by 
    the Model or Derivatives, regardless of whether they are in their original form or have been further 
    processed or modified by the Licensee. This includes, but is not limited to, textual or numerical produced 
    directly or indirectly through the use of the Model.
    1.4 Licensor: LG Management Development Institute Co., Ltd., the owner, developer, and provider of the 
    EXAONE AI Model. The Licensor holds all rights, title, and interest in the Model and is responsible for 
    granting licenses to use the Model under the terms specified in this Agreement.
    1.5 Licensee: The individual, organization, corporation, academic institution, government agency, or other 
    entity using or intending to use the Model under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Licensee 
    is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Agreement by all authorized users who access or utilize 
    the Model on behalf of the Licensee.

2. License Grant
    2.1 Grant of License: Subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement, the Licensor hereby 
    grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and revocable license to:
        a. Access, download, install, and use the Model solely for research purposes. This includes 
        evaluation, testing, academic research, experimentation, and participation in competitions, provided 
        that such participation is in a non-commercial context. Notwithstanding Section 3.1, the Licensee may 
        only provide the Model or Derivatives for a competition if no commercial license is granted to the 
        competition organizer or any third party.
        b. Publicly disclose research results and findings derived from the use of the Model or Derivatives, 
        including publishing papers or presentations.
        c. Modify the Model and create Derivatives based on the Model, provided that such modifications and 
        Derivatives are used exclusively for research purposes. The Licensee may conduct experiments, perform 
        analyses, and apply custom modifications to the Model to explore its capabilities and performance 
        under various scenarios. If the Model is modified, the modified Model must include “EXAONE” at the 
        beginning of its name.
        d. Distribute the Model and Derivatives in each case with a copy of this Agreement.
    2.2 Scope of License: The license granted herein does not authorize the Licensee to use the Model for any 
    purpose not explicitly permitted under this Agreement. Any use beyond the scope of this license, including 
    any commercial application or external distribution, is strictly prohibited unless explicitly agreed upon 
    in writing by the Licensor.

3. Restrictions
    3.1 Commercial Use: The Licensee is expressly prohibited from using the Model, Derivatives, or Output for 
    any commercial purposes, including but not limited to, developing or deploying products, services, or 
    applications that generate revenue, whether directly or indirectly. Any commercial exploitation of the 
    Model or its derivatives requires a separate commercial license agreement with the Licensor. Furthermore, 
    the Licensee shall not use the Model, Derivatives or Output to develop or improve other models.
    3.2 Reverse Engineering: The Licensee shall not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or attempt to 
    derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, or structure of the Model, except to the extent that 
    such activities are expressly permitted by applicable law. Any attempt to bypass or circumvent 
    technological protection measures applied to the Model is strictly prohibited.
    3.3 Unlawful Use: The Licensee shall not use the Model and Derivatives for any illegal, fraudulent, or 
    unauthorized activities, nor for any purpose that violates applicable laws or regulations. This includes 
    but is not limited to the creation, distribution, or dissemination of malicious, deceptive, or unlawful 
    content.
    3.4 Ethical Use: The Licensee shall ensure that the Model or Derivatives is used in an ethical and 
    responsible manner, adhering to the following guidelines:
        a. The Model and Derivatives shall not be used to generate, propagate, or amplify false, misleading, 
        or harmful information, including fake news, misinformation, or disinformation.
        b. The Model and Derivatives shall not be employed to create, distribute, or promote content that is 
        discriminatory, harassing, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise offensive to individuals or groups based 
        on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, or other protected characteristics.
        c. The Model and Derivatives shall not infringe on the rights of others, including intellectual 
        property rights, privacy rights, or any other rights recognized by law. The Licensee shall obtain all 
        necessary permissions and consents before using the Model and Derivatives in a manner that may impact 
        the rights of third parties.
        d. The Model and Derivatives shall not be used in a way that causes harm, whether physical, mental, 
        emotional, or financial, to individuals, organizations, or communities. The Licensee shall take all

        or injury.
