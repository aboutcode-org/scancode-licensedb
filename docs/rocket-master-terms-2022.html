Master Terms and Conditions

Rocket Software, Inc. or its subsidiary designated on an Order Form (&#34;Rocket&#34;)
provides software Products and related Services according to these Software
License and Services Terms (&#34;Terms&#34;). By executing an Order Form dated on or
after the date of these Terms, Customer agrees, for itself and its majority
owned subsidiaries, these Terms apply to the first Order Form Customer executes
(together, the &#34;Agreement&#34;) each Order Form thereafter, Customer&#39;s rights and
obligations, and previously purchased Products and Services. Each Order Form is
a separate contract incorporating these Terms and are the entire terms governing
Customer&#39;s purchase of Products and/or Services. The parties agree that they may
do business electronically, including contract formation, order placement and
acceptance. An order Customer places and Rocket accepts on any Rocket website
will create fully enforceable obligations subject to these Terms.

A. GENERAL TERMS

1. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

Rocket, its affiliates or licensors own and retain all right, title and interest
in all Intellectual Property in Products, Services, Deliverables, Documentation,
(except as otherwise specified herein), developments, research data, designs,
layout, methodologies, processes and procedures, models, formulae, documents,
drawings, plans, specifications and other Rocket information, proprietary
materials and all derivative works. To the extent that any right, title or
interest in or to any Rocket&#39;s Intellectual Property may not automatically vest
in Rocket by operation of law, Customer irrevocably transfers, assigns and
conveys all right, title, and interest therein to Rocket. At Rocket&#39;s request
and expense Customer will promptly take any action and execute any documents
necessary to vest full title in Rocket or its licensor.

2. CONFIDENTIALITY

(a) Confidential Information. Whether or not disclosed orally or marked as
confidential, Confidential Information includes the Agreement; Order Forms,
Products, Deliverables, and Services; either party&#39;s non-public data or
personally identifiable information regarding employees or customer(s) residing
on the party&#39;s computer systems; Intellectual Property, and Rocket&#39;s proposals,
specifications, manuals, product roadmaps, financial data, pricing, and results
of benchmark tests. Confidential Information does not include information that
is (i) publicly available without breach of the Agreement; (ii) reasonably shown
to Disclosing Party&#39;s satisfaction to have been known by Receiving Party prior
to disclosure or independently developed by Receiving Party subsequent to
disclosure without breach of these Terms; or (iii) obtained by Receiving Party
from a third party without confidentiality obligation. Products are not deemed
to be placed in the public domain by Rocket. Receiving Party will promptly
notify Disclosing Party if it is compelled by a court or legal process to
disclose Confidential Information and will take any reasonable action requested
by Disclosing Party to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information.

(b) Non-disclosure. Customer will use best efforts to prevent disclosure to
Rocket of any personally identifiable information (PII) regarding Customer&#39;s
employees or customer(s). Customer is solely responsible for complying with any
requirements regarding PII disclosed to Rocket, other than Rocket&#39;s
confidentiality obligations hereunder. Receiving Party will use Disclosing
Party&#39;s Confidential Information solely to perform its obligations under the
Agreement. Receiving Party will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard
Disclosing Party&#39;s Confidential Information, including no less than the steps
taken to protect its own Confidential Information. Receiving Party must not
disclose Disclosing Party&#39;s Confidential Information except to its employees
bound by written confidentiality obligations, or Affiliates under a duty of
confidentiality, no less restrictive than these Terms. Receiving Party must
promptly notify Disclosing Party in writing of unauthorized use or disclosure of
Confidential Information. Receiving Party, at its expense, must take all
reasonable action to recover Confidential Information and prevent further
unauthorized use or disclosure, including action for seizure and injunctive
relief. If Receiving Party fails to do so in a timely manner, Disclosing Party
may take reasonable action to do so at Receiving Party&#39;s expense, and Receiving
Party must reasonably cooperate.

3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION

(a) By Rocket.

(i) Rocket will defend, at its expense, a third party legal action, suit or
proceeding against Customer (&#34;Claim&#34;) to the extent that a Product, or a
Deliverable that is a Product proprietary derivative work, as delivered by
Rocket to Customer (&#34;Indemnified Product&#34;) directly infringes a valid U.S.
patent or copyright. Rocket will indemnify Customer for any judgment finally
awarded against Customer or settlement agreed by Rocket for such Claim to the
extent of the Indemnified Product&#39;s infringement, provided (1) Customer notifies
Rocket promptly in writing of the Claim, (2) Rocket has sole control over the
defense or settlement, and (3) Customer fully cooperates with Rocket, providing
all documents and information in Customer&#39;s possession relevant to the Claim,
and Customer makes personnel available to testify or consult with Rocket.

(ii) If an Indemnified Product becomes, or in Rocket&#39;s opinion is likely to
become subject to a Claim, Rocket may, at its option and expense, (1) acquire
the right for Customer to continue using the Indemnified Product, (2) replace or
modify the Indemnified Product or create a workaround so that the Indemnified
Product is functionally equivalent and non-infringing, or (3) terminate the
License for the Indemnified Product and give Customer a credit for the Product
Fee paid by Customer for the infringing part of the Indemnified Product, less a
reasonable allowance for the time Customer used the Indemnified Product.

(iii) Rocket is not obligated or liable for a Claim due to: (1) use of an
Indemnified Product not according to the Agreement and Documentation, (2)
modification of an Indemnified Product made by anyone other than Rocket, or
modification made by Rocket for non-standard features or functionality for
Customer or according to Customer&#39;s directions, (3) any products, equipment,
software, or data not supplied by Rocket, (4) use of an Indemnified Product
combined with any other products, equipment, software, or data not supplied by
Rocket if infringement would not occur without  the combination, (5) a release
of Indemnified Product other than the most current release available or
Customer&#39;s failure to install a revision, update or release that would have
eliminated the infringement, (6) Customer&#39;s designs, instructions, plans or
specifications, or (7) use of an Indemnified Product combined with a Customer or
third party use, process or method if infringement would not occur without the
combination.

(b) By Customer.

(i) Customer will defend, at its expense, a third party claim against Rocket (1)
that any product, information, data or material provided by Customer infringes
another party&#39;s intellectual property rights, other than a Claim for which
Rocket is responsible according to Section A3(a) above, or (2) arising from
Customer&#39;s or its Affiliates&#39; failure to comply with the License or
Confidentiality terms of the Agreement.

(ii) Customer will indemnify Rocket for any damages, or amounts agreed as
settlement, for the claim, provided (1) Rocket notifies Customer promptly in
writing of the claim, (2) Customer has sole control over the defense or
settlement, and (3) Rocket cooperates with Customer, providing all documents and
information in Rocket&#39;s possession relevant to the claim, and Rocket makes
personnel available to testify or consult with Customer as reasonably needed.

(c) Assumption of Defense. If a party fails to defend or settle a claim
according to this Section A3 in a timely manner, the other party may assume
defense of the claim at the indemnifying party&#39;s expense, and the indemnifying
party will reasonably cooperate. Neither party may make an admission of fault on
behalf of the other party, or agree to the settlement of a claim binding the
other party that does not contain a full release of liability for the other
party, without written consent. (d) Limitation. THIS SECTION A3 DESCRIBES EACH
PARTY&#39;S SOLE LIABILITY AND THE OTHER PARTY&#39;S SOLE REMEDY FOR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION.

(d) Professional Services Indemnity.  Each party will defend, at their expense,
any action brought against the other party for bodily injury, death, or tangible
property damage to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the defending party relating to a Professional Services
engagement. The defending party will indemnify the other party for and pay
damages finally awarded in such action, or agreed as a settlement by the
indemnifying party, if (a) the other party promptly notifies the indemnifying
party in writing of the claim, (b) the indemnifying party has sole control over
the defense or settlement, and (c) the other party cooperates in the
indemnifying party&#39;s defense or settlement. If a party with an indemnification
obligation fails to defend or settle a claim in a timely manner, the other party
may assume the defense at the obligated party&#39;s expense, and the obligated party
will reasonably cooperate. Neither party may, without the other party&#39;s written
consent, agree to a settlement that: (a) binds the other party, (b) does not
contain a full release of the other party, or (c) admits fault on behalf of the
other party. THIS SECTION A3(d) DESCRIBES EACH PARTY&#39;S SOLE LIABILITY AND THE
OTHER PARTY&#39;S SOLE REMEDY FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INDEMNIFICATION.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

(a) ROCKET, ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR (i) ANY
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, (ii) ANY
INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS, COST OF COVER, GOODWILL, TOLL FRAUD, OR
LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, OR FAILURE OF A REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

(b) EXCEPT FOR A CLAIM FOR INFRINGEMENT UNDER SECTION A3, DEATH OR BODILY INJURY
CLAIMS, TANGIBLE PROPERTY DAMAGE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR FRAUD, ROCKET, ITS
AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT EXCEED THE
AMOUNT CUSTOMER PAID IN THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE THAT
GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM.

(c) THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION A4 WILL APPLY TO ANY DAMAGES, HOWEVER
CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABLITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT,
MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE,
OR OTHERWISE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE OR
UNFORSEEABLE. ROCKET WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM BROUGHT MORE THAN 12
MONTHS AFTER CUSTOMER BECAME AWARE OF THE ISSUE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
ROCKET&#39;S FAILURE TO EXERCISE A RIGHT OR REMEDY IS NOT A WAIVER.

5. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or claim
promptly through business discussions and will, upon written request, escalate a
dispute to executive management for resolution.  If the parties fail to resolve
the dispute within 30 days of written request, or any longer period agreed in
writing, the parties may pursue the remedies to which they are entitled. This
clause will not restrict either party&#39;s right to seek injunctive relief.

6. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Customer&#39;s failure to comply with the License or Confidentiality terms of the
Agreement would result in irreparable harm to Rocket that may be intangible but
real and is incapable of complete remedy by award of damages. Customer agrees
(a) Rocket has the right to an injunction or other court order and may proceed
directly to court to specifically enforce Customer&#39;s obligations, (b) no finding
of irreparable harm or other condition to injunctive relief is required, (c) an
order may be entered to compel Customer to act or refrain from acting or
threatened action, and (d) if an injunction is granted, Customer will pay
Rocket&#39;s reasonable expenses and attorney fees, in addition to any other relief
granted. Rocket shall have the right to pursue all remedies at law and in equity
for such a breach.

7. MISCELLANEOUS

(a) Agreement. The Agreement supersedes all other oral or written terms,
proposals or representations in effect between the parties regarding Rocket
Products and Services. Any terms in a subsequent or contemporaneous Order Form
that are inconsistent with these Terms will control for that Order Form only,
and the General Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by both
parties. Inconsistent terms of Customer&#39;s purchase order are excluded regardless
of Rocket accepting the purchase order for payment purposes. If any Agreement
term is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the other terms remain in full force
and effect and any term that is intended to survive the Agreement termination
will survive.

(b) Assignment. Customer may not assign the Agreement, an Order Form, or any of
its obligations, rights or remedies, in whole or in part, without Rocket&#39;s prior
written approval in its sole discretion.

(c) Force Majeure. Neither party is liable for delay or failing to perform its
obligations due to a cause beyond its reasonable control and without fault or
negligence, except Customer&#39;s failure to perform its payment obligations.
